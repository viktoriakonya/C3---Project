0;0;1;"Die Macher is a game about seven sequential political races in different regions of Germany. Players are in charge of national political parties, and must manage limited resources to help their party to victory. The winning party will have the most victory points after all the regional elections. There are four different ways of scoring victory points. First, each regional election can supply one to eighty victory points, depending on the size of the region and how well your party does in it. Second, if a party wins a regional election and has some media influence in the region, then the party will receive some media-control victory points. Third, each party has a national party membership which will grow as the game progresses and this will supply a fair number of victory points. Lastly, parties score some victory points if their party platform matches the national opinions at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The 1986 edition featured 4 parties from the old West Germany and supported 3-4 players. The 1997 edition supports up to 5 players in the re-united Germany and updated several features of the rules as well.  The 2006 edition also supports up to 5 players and adds a shorter 5 round variant and additional rules updates by the original designer.&#10;&#10;Die Macher is #1 in the Valley Games Classic Line&#10;&#10;";5;240;14;3;240;Die Macher;240;1986;Marcus Gschwendtner;Economic,Negotiation,Political;Karl-Heinz Schmiel;Country: Germany,Valley Games Classic Line;Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Simultaneous Action Selection;Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH,Moskito Spiele,Valley Games, Inc.;7.6650800000000014;4498;die macher;20;0.0;0.0;3.6847826086956514;0;0.0;3hGLSZ61Yk;False;0;5.0;240.0;14.0;3.0;240.0;Die Macher;46;3-5;162;240;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;741;1986.0;die macher

Players compete to gain the favor of three factions: samurai, peasants, and priests, which are represented by helmet, rice paddy, and Buddha tokens scattered about the board, which features the islands of Japan. The competition is waged through the use of hexagonal tiles, each of which help curry favor of one of the three factions &mdash; or all three at once! Players can make lightning-quick strikes with horseback ronin and ships or approach their conquests more methodically. As each token (helmets, rice paddies, and Buddhas) is surrounded, it is awarded to the player who has gained the most favor with the corresponding group.&#10;&#10;Gameplay continues until all the symbols of one type have been removed from the board or four tokens have been removed from play due to a tie for influence.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, players compare captured symbols of each type, competing for majorities in each of the three types.

3;12;13;"In Catan (formerly The Settlers of Catan), players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources (cards)&mdash;wood, grain, brick, sheep, or stone&mdash;to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game.&#10;&#10;Setup includes randomly placing large hexagonal tiles (each showing a resource or the desert) in a honeycomb shape and surrounding them with water tiles, some of which contain ports of exchange. Number disks, which will correspond to die rolls (two 6-sided dice are used), are placed on each resource tile. Each player is given two settlements (think: houses) and roads (sticks) which are, in turn, placed on intersections and borders of the resource tiles. Players collect a hand of resource cards based on which hex tiles their last-placed house is adjacent to. A robber pawn is placed on the desert tile.&#10;&#10;A turn consists of possibly playing a development card, rolling the dice, everyone (perhaps) collecting resource cards based on the roll and position of houses (or upgraded cities&mdash;think: hotels) unless a 7 is rolled, turning in resource cards (if possible and desired) for improvements, trading cards at a port, and trading resource cards with other players. If a 7 is rolled, the active player moves the robber to a new hex tile and steals resource cards from other players who have built structures adjacent to that tile.&#10;&#10;Points are accumulated by building settlements and cities, having the longest road and the largest army (from some of the development cards), and gathering certain development cards that simply award victory points. When a player has gathered 10 points (some of which may be held in secret), he announces his total and claims the win.&#10;&#10;Catan has won multiple awards and is one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to experienced gamers as well as those new to the hobby.&#10;&#10;Die Siedler von Catan was originally published by KOSMOS and has gone through multiple editions. It was licensed by Mayfair and has undergone four editions as The Settlers of Catan. In 2015, it was formally renamed Catan to better represent itself as the core and base game of the Catan series. It has been re-published in two travel editions, portable edition and compact edition, as a special gallery edition (replaced in 2009 with a family edition), as an anniversary wooden edition, as a deluxe 3D collector's edition, in the basic Simply Catan, as a beginner version, and with an entirely new theme in Japan and Asia as Settlers of Catan: Rockman Edition.

4;17;18;"The robots of the Robo Rally automobile factory spend their weekdays toiling at the assembly line. They put in hard hours building high-speed supercars they never get to see in action. But on Saturday nights, the factory becomes a world of mad machines and dangerous schemes as these robots engage in their own epic race.It takes speed, wits, and dirty tricks to become a racing legend! Each player chooses a robot and directs its moves by playing cards. Chaos ensues as all players reveal the cards they've chosen. Players face obstacles like industrial lasers, gaping pits, and moving conveyer belts -- but those can also be used to their advantage! Each player aims to make it to each of the checkpoints in numerical order. The first player to reach all of the checkpoints wins. (source: http://avalonhill.wizards.com/games/robo-rally/comingsoon)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In RoboRally players each control a different robot in a race through a dangerous factory floor. Several goals will be placed on the board and you must navigate your robot to them in a specific order. The boards can be combined in several different ways to accommodate different player counts and races can be as long or as short as player's desire.&#10;&#10;In general, players will first fill all of their robot's &quot;registers&quot; with facedown movement cards. This happens simultaneously and there is a time element involved. If you don't act fast enough you are forced to place cards randomly to fill the rest. Then, starting with the first register, everyone reveals their card. The card with the highest number moves first. After everyone resolves their movement they reveal the next card and so on. Examples of movement cards may be to turn 90 degrees left or right, move forward 2 spaces, or move backward 1 space though there are a bigger variety than that. You can plan a perfect route, but if another robot runs into you it can push you off course. This can be disastrous since you can't reprogram any cards to fix it!&#10;&#10;Robots fire lasers and factory elements resolve after each movement and robots may become damaged. If they take enough damage certain movement cards become fixed and can no longer be changed. If they take more they may be destroyed entirely. The first robot to claim all the goals in the correct order wins, though some may award points and play tournament style.&#10;&#10;The game was reprinted by Avalon Hill (Hasbro/WotC) in 2005.&#10;&#10;";8;120;12;2;45;RoboRally;120;1994;Peter Bergting,Bob Carasca,Phil Foglio,Daniel Gelon,Jennifer Lathrop,Paul Sottosanti,Franz Vohwinkel,Peter Whitley;Miniatures,Racing,Science Fiction;Richard Garfield;Robots;Action / Movement Programming,Grid Movement,Modular Board,Simultaneous Action Selection;999 Games,AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH,Avalon Hill (Hasbro),Hasbro,Play Factory,Wizards of the Coast;7.15355;19371;roborally;1;0.0;0.0;3.2554054054054045;0;0.0;x0sk1fJyaz;False;0;8.0;120.0;12.0;2.0;45.0;Roborally;185;2-8;548;45-120;0.0;49.95;199.99;0.0;521;1994.0;roborally
5;18;19;"A long time ago, in a village far, far away, some disturbed townsfolk decided to destroy their entire town in order to rid themselves of an evil menace (it's technically a dog-mouse, but I think it's an idiomatic thing).  Anyway, so the villagers rebuilt all the buildings in the town (including their precious outhouses), but forgot to include city walls, a river, or roads.  To rectify this, players lay tiles with one of these three things onto the board, and any building caught underneath them is automatically eliminated, except for outhouses.  When an outhouse would be destroyed, players take a vote on whether to place that particular section.  Each player is trying to retain the most of one type of building, and once all the pieces have been placed the winner is the person with the highest valued buildings still standing.&#10;&#10;Wacky, Wacky West re-make description:&#10;&#10;Fans of Klaus Teuber will be interested in this remake/redesign of Drunter und Dr&uuml;ber, a 1991 Spiel des Jahres winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;Just south of nowhere, there's the junction of the Mayfair &amp; Rossdorf RR and the Turvy Trunk Line. Springing up from the desert like a tumbleweed lies the eccentric little town of Rossdorf. Like most western towns, Rossdorf has a Land Agent: Guy Dough, the brother of that wicked varmint Black Benny. A shrewd opportunist, Guy's done sold all the town land ('ceptin' the outhouses) four times over! Every acre in town that ain't got an outhouse on it is owned by the miners, the railroads, AND the fort captain. Just about a year ago, miners digging in the shadow of Fort Rossdorf struck the mother lode! But it wasn't gold, and it wasn't silver. No, my friend, it was just a little spring. Not any ordinary spring, though! It was a torrent of that mind-marbling drink the locals call &quot;Wacky Water!&quot; &#10;&#10;&#10;Now that water's done what the sun and the wind couldn't do: it's made those landholders brave enough to take matters into their own hands. Now they'll use whatever means they can to bowl over the competition and lay claim to the only fertile spots left in town! Now the only thing stoppin' 'em is the Town Charter Amendment #5, which states: &quot;no landholder may move, remove, or detonate any outhouse without a majority vote of the Town Citizens...&quot; Now one thing's for sure: something's gonna stink in Rossdorf, purty darn soon.....&#10;&#10;&#10;In Wacky Wacky West you and your fellow townfolk place track tiles, street tiles, and river tiles hoping to destroy your rivals' buildings.

On this journey, there are battles to be fought against roving bands of brigands, dragons, plague and hunger.  There are bazaars to visit to purchase supplies and assistants for the quest.  There are uncharted territories to get lost in and tombs and ruins to plunder.  And there is a mighty army to be raised before the player can lay seige to the tower and fight either to glorious victory or crushing defeat.&#10;&#10;Dated and primitive by today's standards, Dark Tower was nevertheless an astonishing achievement when it was released in 1981.  Every aspect of the game was monitored by a small computer inside the black plastic shell of the tower itself, an unheard of innovation at the time.  Players input their moves on a small membrane keypad each turn and the computer took over from there, doing everything from conducting the progress of battles to keeping track of how much (or little) food was left to feed the players' always hungry warriors.  It could even play recognizable pieces of music at significant points during the game.&#10;&#10;";4;90;10;1;90;Dark Tower;90;1981;Bob Pepper;Adventure,Electronic,Exploration,Fantasy,Fighting;Roger Burten,Alan Coleman,Vincent A.

The board has one column for each possible total of two six-sided dice, but the number of spaces in each column varies: the more probable a total, the more spaces in that column and the more rolls it takes to complete. On their turn, a player rolls four dice and arranges them in duos: 1 4 5 6 can become 1+4 and 5+6 for 5 &amp; 11, 1+5 and 4+6 for 6 &amp; 10, or 1+6 and 4+5 for 7 &amp; 9. The player places or advances progress markers in the open column(s) associated with their chosen totals, then chooses whether to roll again or end their turn and replace the progress markers with markers of their color. A player can only advance three different columns in a turn and cannot advance a column which any player has closed out by reaching the end space; if a roll doesn&rsquo;t result in any legal plays, the turn ends with that turn&rsquo;s progress lost.&#10;&#10;A predecessor from 1974, The Great Races, exists as a paper-and-pencil game.&#10;&#10;";4;30;9;2;30;Can't Stop;30;1980;Gabriel Laulunen (II),Walter Pepperle,Klaus Wilinski;Dice;Sid Sackson;;Dice Rolling,Press Your Luck;Asmodee,Borras Plana S.A.,Clipper,Eagle-Gryphon Games,Editrice Giochi,Face2Face Games,franjos Spieleverlag,Miro Company,New Games Order, LLC,Palitoy Ltd.,Parker Brothers,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH;6.85659;9095;can't stop;23;2.0;2.0;3.3816770186335403;0;-0.51;fjEr4WSlRJ;False;0;4.0;45.0;9.0;2.0;30.0;Can't Stop;161;2-4;4362;30-45;60.42;72.95;0.0;0.0;2073;1980.0;can't stop
8;38;42;"Regarded by many as Reiner Knizia's masterpiece, Tigris &amp; Euphrates is set in the ancient fertile crescent with players building civilizations through tile placement. Players are given four different leaders: farming, trading, religion, and government. The leaders are used to collect victory points in these same categories. However, your score at the end of the game is the number of points in your weakest category, which encourages players not to get overly specialized. Conflict arises when civilizations connect on the board, i.e., external conflicts, with only one leader of each type surviving such a conflict. Leaders can also be replaced within a civilization through internal conflicts.&#10;&#10;Starting in the Mayfair edition from 2008, Tigris &amp; Euphrates included a double-sided game board and extra components for playing an advanced version of the game. This &quot;ziggurat expansion&quot;, initially released as a separate item in Germany for those who already owned the base game, is a special monument that extends across five spaces of the board. The monument can be built if a player has a cross of five civilization tokens of the same color by discarding those five tokens and replacing them with the ziggurat markers, placing a ziggurat tower upon the middle tile. The five ziggurat markers cannot be destroyed. All rules regarding monuments apply to the ziggurat monument as well. If your king is inside the kingdom of the ziggurat, you will get one victory point in a color of your choice at the end of your turn.&#10;&#10;Some versions of Tigris &amp; Euphrates are listed as being for 2-4 players, while others incorrectly state that they're for 3-4 players.

This is generally considered a good &quot;couples&quot; game and is often recommended for people with non-gamer partners.&#10;&#10;The object the game is to gain points by mounting profitable archaeological expeditions to the different sites represented by the 5 colors. On a player's turn they must always first play one card, either to an expedition or by discarding it to the appropriate discard pile, and then draw one card. There is a separate discard pile for each color and a player may draw the top card of any discard pile or the top card of the deck. Cards played to expeditions must be in ascending order but they need not be consecutive. Handshakes are considered lower than a 2 and represent investments in an expedition. Thus, if you play a red 4, you may play any other red card higher than a 4 on a future turn but may no longer play a handshake, the 2, or the 3.&#10;&#10;The game continues in this fashion with players alternating turns until the final card is taken from the draw pile. The rest of the cards in hand are then discarded and players score their expeditions. Each expedition that has at least one card played into it must be scored. Cards played into an expedition are worth their rank in points, and handshakes count as a multiplier against your final total. Expeditions start at a value of -20 so you must play at least 20 points of cards into an expedition in order to make a profit. If you are left with a negative value and have a handshake, the multiplier still applies. A 20-point bonus is awarded to every expedition with at least 8 cards played into it. The player with the most points wins the game, but it is typical to play 3 matches and add your score from each to see who wins.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 1: an expedition has a 2,3,7,8,10 for a total of 30. This expedition is worth 10 total points: 30 minus the initial -20.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 2: an expedition has 2 HS, and 4,5,6,7,8,10 for a total of 40. This expedition is worth 80 total points: 40 points for cards, minus the initial 20, &times;3 for the 2 multipliers, plus the 20-pt bonus for playing 8+ cards.&#10;&#10;Scoring example 3: an expedition has 1 HS, and 4,6,7 for a total of 17. This expedition is worth -6 total points: 17 minus initial 20, &times;2 for the multiplier.&#10;&#10;";2;30;10;2;30;Lost Cities;30;1999;Grafik Studio Krüger,Michaela Kienle,Anke Pohl,Thilo Rick,Claus Stephan,Franz Vohwinkel;Card Game,Exploration;Reiner Knizia;Archaeology,Card Games: Draw and Discard Games,Kosmos two-player series,Lost Cities;Hand Management,Set Collection;999 Games,Albi,Competo / Marektoy,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Galakta,Kaissa Chess & Games,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,KOSMOS,Laser plus,Midgaard Games,Piatnik,Playhouse Ltd,Rio Grande Games,Stupor Mundi,Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.,Tilsit,Zvezda;7.14784;26686;lost cities;11;1.6;2.2;3.5433270925110136;0;0.28;LTnLSWIcbH;False;8;2.0;45.0;10.0;2.0;30.0;Lost Cities;454;2;5335;30-45;14.47;31.99;18.95;0.0;3306;1999.0;lost cities

There's a four-piece modular board that forms a large room with walls spread around the board. There are also color-coded targets on boards. Placed on top of the surface are four robots. The idea for each turn/puzzle is to get the like-colored robot to a randomly selected target. The trick is that once a robot starts moving, it will continue to move until a wall or another robot stops it.

It covers the development of ancient civilizations from the invention of agriculture c. 8000 B.C. to the emergence of Rome around the middle of the third century B.C.  Each player leads a nation of peoples over a map board of the Eastern Mediterranean and Near East as they attempt to carve a niche for themselves and their culture.&#10;&#10;Although battles and territorial strategy are important, this is not a war game because it is not won by battle or conquest.  Instead, the object of play is to gain a level of overall advancement involving cultural, economic, and political factors so that such conflicts that do arise are a result of rivalry and land shortage rather than a desire to eliminate other players.  Nomad and farmer, warrior and merchant, artisan and citizen all have an essential part to play in the development of civilization.  It is the player who most effectively changes emphasis between these various outlooks who will achieve the best balance - and win.&#10;&#10;(from the Introduction to the Avalon Hill edition rulebook)&#10;&#10;This game has a huge following and is widely regarded as one of the best games about ancient civilizations.  Each player takes on the role of leader of an ancient civilization, such as the Illyrians or Babylonians.  Your task is to guide your people through the ages by expanding your empire and using its proceeds to finance new technological advances, such as Literacy, Metalworking, or Law.  The advancements help your civilization better cope with its problems as well as help bring new advancements.&#10;&#10;Civilization is widely thought to be the first game ever to incorporate a &quot;technology tree,&quot; allowing players to gain certain items and abilities only after particular other items were obtained.

In each turn, players attempt to change the allegiance of one land district, contributing power cards to swing the conflict in their favor. Players also choose roles such as Diplomat, Traitor, and Builder that give them special abilities for that turn.

18;79;93;"In this award-winning game, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain.  The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions.  To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of colored cubes) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions.  After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo - a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards varying from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a caballero majority in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any cubes you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region.

The game still has a very devoted following, which is a tribute to the depth of the various strategies and approaches.  The game is divided into two realms, the masterboard and the battleboards.  On the masterboard, legions of mythical creatures roam about trying to recruit bigger and badder monsters and kill opposing legions in the process.  When a combat occurs, the action moves to the corresponding battleboard type corresponding to the area the fight is taking place in.  After lots of dice are tossed, the army that remains standing is returned to the masterboard with the spoils of war: points.&#10;&#10;The points are used to recruit Angels and Archangels and to augment the leader character of the player's army: The Titan.

Resources are much more segregated by region, with each region specializing in a few resources based on their back story (which is written in the manual).&#10;&#10;";6;240;12;2;240;Iron Dragon;240;1994;Larry Elmore,Chris Vande Voort;Fantasy,Trains,Transportation;Darwin Bromley,Tom Wham;Empire Builder Rail Games;Crayon Rail System,Pick-up and Deliver;Mayfair Games;6.95603;1372;iron dragon;64;0.0;0.0;3.416666666666667;0;0.0;u1w7mCmqFG;False;0;6.0;240.0;12.0;2.0;240.0;Iron Dragon;12;2-6;40;240;0.0;0.0;52.95;51.68;664;1994.0;iron dragon

Ages 6 and up.&#10;&#10;PitchCar and Carabande are dexterity games where large, wooden, puzzle-like pieces are used to construct a race track that looks very similar to a slot car track when finished.  But instead of using electrons, players use finger-flicks to send small pucks around the track, a la Carrom.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;     Eight car discs&#10;     One black &quot;spacer&quot; disc&#10;     Six straightaways &#10;     Ten 90-degree curves &#10;     Rail pieces for straights and curves&#10;     One Start/Finish line sticker&#10;     One rule sheet with suggested track layouts&#10;     One score pad&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Carabande was produced by Goldsieber and had only the single expansion with the Action Set.

The deck is numbered from 1 to 98, with some of the cards having green bullheads and others having red bullheads.  In this game greens are positive points and reds are negative points.  As in 6 Nimmt!, players are constructing sets of cards, with the fifth card in a set taking the whole thing.  This time, however, players take their turns sequentially and can play one to three cards from their hands.&#10;&#10;In a confusing twist, the Dutch edition of 6 Nimmt! is called Take 5! but is the progenitor game, not this game.&#10;&#10;";6;60;10;2;60;Take 5!;60;1998;Franz Vohwinkel;Card Game;Wolfgang Kramer;6 nimmt!,Animals: Cattle;Hand Management,Set Collection;999 Games,AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH;6.42598;1414;take 5!;90;0.0;0.0;4.0;0;0.0;WnkjZzWz1L;True;0;6.0;60.0;10.0;2.0;60.0;Take 5!;6;2-6;17;60;17.55;0.0;0.0;0.0;108;1998.0;take 5!
30;134;157;"Eurorails is another entry in the Mayfair Games crayon rail games, like Empire Builder and India Rails.  Its puzzle-piece board forms a map of Europe broken down into dots.  Players use different-colored crayons to draw rail from dot to dot, building their rail system.  A large deck of cards is used to determine how much money will be generated by picking up a particular commodity and delivering it to the listed city, with the payoffs being related to how far away the source is from the destination.  As players generate more money, they build successively larger and more comprehensive rail systems, hopefully connecting to almost all the major cities.

31;141;168;"Epic Railroad Building in North America&#10;&#10;Discover a modern North American classic.  Celebrate one of our most vital and enduring passions: railroads.  Use your initial investment to build track.  Then pick up commodities where they are grown, mined, or manufactured and deliver them to a lucrative place of demand.  Complete a delivery and make the money you need to buy larger, faster trains, and expand your railroad empire.  Win the game by building the most effective railroad empire!&#10;&#10;The original and flagship of Mayfair's crayon-rails line allows players, using washable crayons, to draw their train routes over a map of North America.  Players start with an initial sum of money which they use to build short lengths of track during their first couple of turns.  For the rest of the game, players operate their trains over the track network drawn on the board to pick up and deliver loads to various cities, and then have the opportunity to add to their track network or improve their train.  The game uses demand cards which list three demands, each of a commodity to be delivered to a specified city for a given payoff.  Each player has three demand cards to provide opportunities for income.&#10;&#10;Each turn consists of an operations phase and a building phase.  During the operations phase, trains are moved to cities where commodities are picked up at no cost and moved to one of the cities on that player's demand cards.  When the commodity is delivered, the player receives the payoff and trades that demand card for a new one.  Event cards are mixed in the deck with the demand cards.  When an event card is drawn the instructions are followed.  During the building phase a player may pay to build more track or upgrade his train.&#10;&#10;A player wins by being the first to connect his track network to six of the seven major cities on the board and acquire $250,000,000 in cash on hand.&#10;&#10;";6;180;12;2;180;Empire Builder;180;1982;Peter Y.

32;143;170;"Family Business takes mob warfare to a new level of backstabbing, revenge, and general bloodthirstiness, which is what makes it such a blast to play.  Every player controls a 'family' and plays various cards to off other players' family members.  In a game with this little structure, it's possible for everyone to gang up on one unlucky soul, or for the damage to be fairly evenly spread.  Either way, the last family standing is victorious.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with a gang of nine characters. To try to get rid of other gangsters, contracts are played on them. If these contracts are not blocked by anyone, the targeted gangster is placed on the hitlist. As soon as six gangsters are on the hitlist a mobwar is started. This means that, at the start of every turn, the first character on this list is eliminated. This goes on until the list is empty.&#10;Mobwars can also be triggered by cards being played. When no more than the last six or fewer characters are in play a constant mobwar is going on, until only one player has characters left.&#10;&#10;In general players take turns clockwise, however, the turn goes to any player who plays a response card and then clockwise mode is resumed with the player next to him/her. Lots of interaction as players play cards to put gangsters on the list, save them, have them replaced, start a Mob War, or stop it...&#10;&#10;";6;30;8;2;30;Family Business;30;1982;David B.

38;182;221;"Shogun / Samurai Swords / Ikusa is the last game in the original Milton Bradley Gamemaster series. It focuses on the chaotic feudal society of Japan during the Middle Ages. Players play one of several factions that erupt into a civil war, trying to consolidate their strongholds and then defeat other armies for the right to be called Shogun, the supreme ruler.&#10;&#10;In the game, players command forces on islands of feudal Japan.  Player forces include provincial forces in the provinces and mobile armies commanded by daimyos.  In each turn, players will allocate their koku into bids and purchases for the round.  The round begins with the allocation of turn order, which is determined by bid, and in the case of tied bids, by player agreement or random draw.  Then players other bids and payments are accounted for in purchases of castles and fortresses, drafting of new troops and ronin, and a bid for the lone ninja.  Following the bids phase, players in turn order plan and execute attacks against enemy territories, with attacks resolved through die rolls.  A player wins the game when he or she has captured a certain number of territories, either via straight conquest or by vanquishing the last of an opponent's diamyos and taking over that player's forces.&#10;&#10;The game was originally published as Shogun and was later changed to Samurai Swords due to a name conflict with James Clavell's Shogun.

39;198;242;"Players represent various families in Republica de los Bananas.&#10;&#10;Each game turn has between 7 and 9 rounds, drawing cards, President assigns roles, foreign aid money is drawn, the president proposes a budget which is voted on, locations are chosen, there are assassination attempts, then the bank may be open or not, there may be a coup and aftermath, then the next round starts.&#10;&#10;The game is for 4 to 7 players (although there are 2 and 3 player variants).  A president for life (El Presidente) is elected and then she or he allocates roles for all other players.  Depending upon his or her office and the various cards they hold, each player has a certain number of votes. These are important for the first vote to elect El Presidente and then there are votes each turn on the budget proposed by the President. The budget starts when the President draws 8 money cards face down from the money deck (which varies in denomination from $1 to $3) and proposes allocations. Not everyone will be included in the budget and the amounts are at the President's discretion. The President can keep undisclosed foreign aid money.&#10;&#10;Players may attempt to assassinate the other players including the President by guessing where they will be from among five locations. Players who successfully assassinate another player take that player's unbanked money, the only safe money is the money that has been deposited in a players' Swiss bank account, and the only way to get to the bank is to survive the assassination round.&#10;&#10;If players are unhappy, see an advantage, or just want to, and there is a 'coup excuse', they can start a coup. A coup sees players compete using armed forces to control a majority of the 5 power centers. Rebel players control the forces of the role which they were assigned prior to the coup  (e.g. army, navy, air force), and players loyal to the President do the same, seeking to control the strongholds until the coup is over. At the conclusion of each coup players who have control of the 5 power centres vote to be pro-President or pro-Junta determining if the President stays, or the Junta wins and elects a new President. And someone is sent to the firing squad.&#10;&#10;Players assassinated or killed simply become another member of their family and begin again with new cards, but keeping any of their family's funds deposited in their Swiss bank account.&#10;&#10;The game is won by whoever has the most pesos in their Swiss bank account when the money runs out.&#10;&#10;";7;240;16;2;240;Junta;240;1978;Larry Catalano,Peter Corless,Stephen Crane,Stefan Dick,James Dunn,Martin Hoffmann,Jon Rettich,Claus Stephan;Bluffing,Humor,Mafia,Negotiation,Political,Wargame;Eric Goldberg,Ben Grossman,Steve Marsh,Steven Marsh,Vincent Tsao,Nikola Vrtis;;Area Movement,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Simultaneous Action Selection,Trading,Variable Player Powers,Voting;Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG),ASS Altenburger Spielkarten,Borras Plana S.A.,Creative Wargames Workshop,Descartes Editeur,Ediciones MasQueOca,Hobby Japan,Matagot,Pegasus Spiele,Purgatory Publishing, Inc.,Schmidt Spiele,The Toy Company Argentina S.R.L.,West End Games;6.76122;4450;junta;67;0.0;0.0;2.8571428571428568;0;0.25;MPJ9G1Abo9;False;0;7.0;240.0;14.0;2.0;120.0;Junta;28;2-7;16;120-240;29.95;0.0;36.99;0.0;426;1978.0;junta

While ASL is &quot;advanced,&quot; it actually is a simpler game than the original Squad Leader became after the three follow-on gamettes. This three-ring binder is the basic rules for the entire system, and provides the ultimate combination of playability and detail. Full-color charts and beautiful pictures make this the most readable of rulebooks - and includes a full-service index as well for quick reference.&#10;&#10;And ASL is more than &quot;squads&quot; - the system includes the rules for everything from machine guns to bazookas, tanks and ordnance weapons, paratrooper drops, glider landings and beach assaults. And much more. This set of rules is constantly kept up to date by expansions included with the modules.&#10;&#10;ASL goals are scenario-defined, and vary from tasks such as exiting troops off of one edge of the board, to inflicting a certain number of casualty points on the opposing force, to capturing a certain number of goal buildings or areas.&#10;&#10;This is just the rulebook. To start playing the game the newcomer must get, at least, the Beyond Valor: ASL Module 1. There are a great many ASL Modules available. &quot;Core Modules&quot; provide additional rules, units from different nationalities, and additional geomorphic mapboards. &quot;Historical Modules&quot; provide campaign games simulating multi-day battles using actual historical maps rather than geomorphic mapboards, including additional rules, counters, and paper maps.

There's been a boating accident, and a rag-tag group of six lifeboats is trying to make its way to one of several islands just over the horizon.  However only one boat will make any forward progress in a given turn, so players try to convince everyone to vote for his particular favorite.  To further complicate matters, the sailors can't seem to decide which boat they want to be in, so they're constantly jumping out of boats to swim to another one.  As if all that wasn't enough, one of the boats springs a leak each turn.  If the boat is at maximum occupancy when the leak occurs, then players vote to decide who to toss to the sharks!&#10;&#10;";6;90;12;3;90;Lifeboats;90;1993;Matthias Catrein,Wolfgang Steinmeyer;Nautical,Negotiation;Ronald Wettering;Admin: Better Description Needed!;Player Elimination,Simultaneous Action Selection,Voting;Argentum Verlag,Walter Müller's Spielewerkstatt,Z-Man Games;6.6131;2986;lifeboats;36;0.0;0.0;3.1944444444444446;0;0.0;fJ4Pglq9zC;False;0;6.0;90.0;12.0;3.0;90.0;Lifeboats;36;3-6;88;90;0.0;39.95;0.0;15.03;629;1993.0;lifeboats

44;226;278;"Catan Card Game bears only a slight resemblance to The Settlers of Catan, the original game in the Catan series.  There are six resources: wool, wood, bricks, grain, ore, and gold. Before beginning the game, the players receive six square cards showing the resources, with a different die number on each card. In addition, the players start the game with two village cards and a road card connecting them. There are card stacks of more roads and villages, as well as cities, to be purchased during the game. With each new village or city comes two new resource cards. Villages and cities give victory points.&#10;&#10;When the number die is rolled, instead of collecting more cards, the players rotate the corresponding card 90 degrees to indicate a gain of one more of that resource; i.e., the brick card shows a picture of one brick on one edge of the card, two bricks on the next clockwise edge, three bricks along the third edge, and zero bricks on the fourth edge. There is also an event die, with five possible outcomes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     a reward for the player with more knight points or more 'windmill' points (a picture of a windmill on some cards),&#10;     a bonus resource,&#10;     an attack if a player has too many resources, and&#10;     one of six special events - civil war, conflict, master builder, plague, productive year, or progress.     &#10;&#10;&#10;There are 62 expansion cards in six stacks in the center of the table. Before beginning the game, players choose one stack, go through it, and choose three cards to hold in their hands. Forty-two of the expansion cards require spending resources to be put into play, gaining civic improvements or knights. Every civic improvement serves some useful function or adds victory points or both. Twenty of the cards are actions benefiting one of the players or harming the other. After a player pays to put a card down or uses an action card, he blindly draws a replacement. Unwanted or unusable cards can be traded in future turns. Some of the cards have flags on them, indicating victory points.&#10;&#10;Whoever first has twelve victory points wins the game!&#10;&#10;";2;90;10;2;90;Catan Card Game;90;1996;Tanja Donner,Pete Fenlon,Jason Hawkins,Matt Schwabel,Klaus Teuber,Franz Vohwinkel,Stephen Graham Walsh;Card Game,City Building,Territory Building;Klaus Teuber;Catan,Die Siedler von Catan: Das Kartenspiel / Catan Card Game,Kosmos two-player series;Card Drafting,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Trading;999 Games,Competo / Marektoy,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Galakta,Giochi Uniti,KOSMOS,Laser plus,Mayfair Games,Piatnik,Smart Ltd,Tilsit;6.77393;11105;catan card game;74;0.0;0.0;3.0815686274509804;0;0.0;MiOTS94YV3;False;0;4.0;60.0;10.0;2.0;45.0;Catan Card Game;85;2-4;150;45-60;49.96;0.0;0.0;0.0;254;1996.0;catan card game

46;273;334;"Don't let the name fool you. The game has nothing to do with Monopoly. The name was obviously chosen in an attempt to capitalize on that mega-selling monster.&#10;&#10;There are four tracts of land illustrated on the board, which depicts an ocean-front boardwalk. Each tract of land contains five properties valued from $1 million to $8 million. Each turn, a player rolls two regular dice and one special die. The special die has four sides depicting a color matching one of the land tracts, with the other two sides depicting a 'W' and 'F' respectively. The number rolled on the regular two dice is the amount of money the player can spend on development, while the color depicted on the special die is the tract of land he may build on. Thus, if a player rolled an 8 and a red, he has $8 million to spend on developing buildings in the red tract. He can split this $8 million as he sees fit. For example, he may build a building on the $5 million plot and one on the $3 million plot; or he may opt to build one building on the $8 million plot. Quite a few building options here.&#10;&#10;If a 'W' was rolled instead of a color, the player may select which tract he wishes to build on. The 'F' means that a player draws a Fortune card and does not build that turn. Fortune cards allow a player to perform a variety of actions, including constructing extra buildings, moving one of his already placed buildings, removing an opponent's building, etc. A player may play one of these Fortune cards per turn.&#10;&#10;When a player constructs a building and obtains the most buildings on a particular plot, he takes the deed to that property and moves his token along the boardwalk an amount equal to the value of the deed. If a player wrested control of the deed from an opponent, the opponent is then moved back that number of spaces. Buildings are placed on the board in a fashion identical to that used in Manhattan...they are stacked on top of existing buildings. If there is a tie for the most buildings, the player who built first on that plot possesses the deed.&#10;&#10;Some have described this game as 'Manhattan lite', and they're not far off. One certainly has similar thought processes and must constantly keep an eye out for optimum plays which will wrest control of deeds (control of buildings in Manhattan) from opponents. There's another planning element thrown in, too. Certain spaces along the boardwalk are marked with an 'F'. If a player advances his token to one of these locations, he draws a Fortune card. These cards can be extremely powerful and cause a severe swing in deed controls. Thus, it is not always wise to go for the largest deed acquisition if a lesser gain would allow you to move your token onto an 'F' location. Clever.&#10;&#10;The game continues until one player has placed all of his buildings (sounds a bit like Rheinl&#195;&#164;nder, doesn't it?) or until one player has reached the end of the boardwalk. The player with the highest total value of deeds is the victor.&#10;&#10;";4;60;8;2;60;Advance to Boardwalk;60;1985;;Economic;Charles Phillips;Monopoly;Area Control / Area Influence,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Take That;Borras Plana S.A.,Editrice Giochi,Parker Brothers;5.35075;626;advance to boardwalk;83;0.0;0.0;2.590791666666666;0;0.0;q7uULjCG2C;False;0;4.0;60.0;8.0;2.0;60.0;Advance to Boardwalk;12;2-4;7;60;0.0;0.0;29.95;0.0;71;1985.0;advance to boardwalk

You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.

Successfully claim five stones, or any three adjacent stones, and you win the game.&#10;&#10;In 2000 GMT published a rethemed version as Battle Line which includes an extra 10 &quot;tactics&quot; cards that modify the standard game play, and with cards that run from 1 to 10 (instead of 1 to 9).&#10;&#10;The 2004 Edition of Schottentotten has these &quot;tactics&quot; cards too.&#10;Schotten-Totten FAQ.&#10;&#10;";2;20;8;2;20;Schotten Totten;20;1999;Dorien Boekhorst,Jean-Baptiste Reynaud,Bärbel Skarabelo;Card Game,Deduction;Reiner Knizia;Country: Scotland,IELLO: Mini Games,Schotten-Totten;Hand Management,Set Collection;ASS Altenburger Spielkarten,Cube Factory of Ideas,Edge Entertainment,IELLO,Pro Ludo,PS-Games,Schmidt Spiele,Ubik,uplay.it edizioni;7.294119999999999;3732;schotten totten;15;0.0;0.0;3.625863055502576;0;0.0;Hkx63V3Zda;False;0;2.0;30.0;8.0;2.0;15.0;Schotten Totten;107;2;717;15-30;14.99;19.0;13.95;11.18;931;1999.0;schotten totten
52;311;380;"Once rare and mysterious, now thankfully back in print, Polarity is a 2-player game using lots of magnets (so keep it away from credit cards, watches and so on). The plastic coated pieces look like Reversi/Othello discs, with black and white faces. Each piece contains a magnet, with the black side being North and the white side being South. Each player gets a stack, one plays black one plays white. A neutral red piece goes in the center of the game cloth and players start by place five each of their stack around the cloth. These flat pieces are the foundations.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you take one piece from your stack into your hand, then bring it to bear against one of your foundations. You keep your color face up, so the opposing polarity bears against your foundation piece. This way, you can very carefully balance your new piece in the air against the foundation stone! This is just fantastic to see. The board fills up with lots of discs teetering at 45 degrees, ready to fly about if the balances are upset.&#10;&#10;Get it right and your stack is one piece smaller. Make a mistake and  your turn ends. Either a piece falls flat somewhere (becoming a new foundation) or pieces jump together making towers or into your hand. Your opponent takes the tower you accidentally made and places it their side up where they like. Towers get you points at the game end.&#10;&#10;If a piece jumps to the stone in your hand, they both go back on your stack. The game ends when one player finishes their stack and points are calculated based upon towers and discs remaining. Causing the red piece to jump to another loses you the game outright.&#10;&#10;To be honest, the scoring matters less than the tension and joy of watching the natural but weird force of magnetism at play. Because the discs are discs, they can easily roll around, causing domino effects. Because the towers increase the magnetic pull, they make it so much harder to find a safe spot to play.&#10;&#10;If you want a strange fun game to amaze your friends and family, Polarity is hard to beat. If you want a serious 2-player game, you may prefer other abstracts. The rules could do with being shorter and simpler. Otherwise, a joyous game.&#10;&#10;Comment from the designer &quot;Polarity began as a sculpture. Polarity is zen. It represents that point where absolute opposites merge. In this case, the poles of the magnetic field. The quality of play is determined by one's ability to perceive balance in the midst of extremes. Each game is unique and can never be reproduced. It is in that uniqueness that I was awarded a patent from the U.S. Pat. &amp; Trdmks. office for magnetic principle. The strategy must be viewed 3-dimensionally. It is not just control of a 2-dimensional board but must include the space above and below the playing surface.&quot;&#10;&#10;";4;20;8;2;20;Polarity;20;1986;;Abstract Strategy,Action / Dexterity;Douglas Seaton;;;Blue Opal,EKOS,Ekos-USA, Inc.,Ferti,IRWIN Games,Kids On Science, Inc.,Polarity House, Inc.,Tangent Toy Co.,Telemotion Technologies,Temple Games, Inc.;6.41286;1600;polarity;13;0.0;0.0;3.1625;0;0.0;l34h9WM75g;False;0;4.0;20.0;8.0;2.0;20.0;Polarity;20;2-4;42;20;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;123;1986.0;polarity

Players use cards to place bridges between these islands or remove opponent's bridges. If you get the majority of bridges around an island, you place one of your marker stones on it and also remove any of your opponent's bridges to that island &ndash; which might cause them to lose a bridge majority on an adjacent island and lose a marker stone there.&#10;&#10;The game is played in three rounds.

55;325;398;"Wildlife Safari was originally published by AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH as Flinke Pinke. This game is one of those 'painfully simple' Reiner Knizia games. There are five different colored chips, with six cards, zero through five, in each of the colors.  The cards are dealt out, and then players take turns playing a card and taking any available chip.  When one color has all six cards played on it, then the game is over, and players use the last card played in each category to value their chips.  The highest total value wins.&#10;&#10;Description of 1994 Milton Bradley re-issue Quandary, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;A game of placement, shares and nerve by Reiner Knizia, this is a lovely edition with nice, heavy tiles akin to Mah-jong pieces in weight and feel. Players in turn lay numbered pieces on tracks curling to the centre, and then take a share in any colour. The round ends when a track is filled. Scoring is based on your total share multiplied by the value of the final tile played on each track. So if you are collecting blue shares, I'll try and lay a blue 1 as near last as possible. Then you'll want to play a blue 5 to raise your possible score, but must take a share in a different colour. Same game, different production.&#10;&#10;Description of 2003 Fantasy Flight Games re-issue, Loco!, for 2-4 players:&#10;&#10;Here is the FOURTH version of the game that was originally Flinke Pinke only this time, the added &quot;rule&quot; is that whenever you play a card with a value of &quot;0&quot;, you must say &quot;Loco!&quot; aloud or forfeit your opportunity to select one of the colored chips.  Apart from that, the game is identical.&#10;&#10;Description of the 2010 Eagle-Gryphon Games games re-issue, Botswana, for 2-5 players:&#10;&#10;This fifth version of the game adds a safari theme.

The 2010 release of the game re-themed what was then called Stimmt So!' to Alhambra: The Card Game, after the popular Alhambra franchise and related, award-winning game Alhambra.  Alhambra, is itself derived from Stimmt So!. The original version of the game, Al Capone, was published in 1992 by a self-publishing company, db-Spiele, which was owned by the game designer Dirk Henn.&#10;&#10;The re-theming of Stimmt So! and Alhambra: The Card Game resulted in the same game with different themes and only minor differences. Changes between Stimmt So! to Alhambra: The Card Game include:&#10;1) The initial money rules from Alhambra are used.&#10;2) The 2 player variant rules from Alhambra are used.&#10;&#10;Stimmt So! A description of this version:&#10;Using mechanics similar to Union Pacific or its predecessor, Airlines, this game is about acquiring stock interests in the various aspects of a large corporation.  There are six &#10;different types of stock, which will reward the majority and sometimes the minority stockholders throughout the game.  Stock is made available by drawing cards on a four-card queue.  Each of the positions on the queue is a different stock market, which means there are four different currencies (Dollar, Euro, Ruble, Yen).  The currency cards are drawn from another queue on the same board.  A turn is quite simple - either take one of the four available currency cards or use some of your currency cards to purchase one of the available stocks.  If you pay more than the amount indicated on the stock card, the excess is lost.  However, if you purchase the stock for the exact printed price, then you can buy another stock, and so on.  After two randomly distributed payouts, the game ends with a final payout with the final stock card.  The player with the highest payout point total is the winner.&#10;&#10;Al Capone  A description of this version:&#10;Using Influence cards, you collect Trade cards from different areas of town under the Mafia control, giving you control over the Distillery, the Chinese Laundry, the Betting Shop, etc. If you spend the exact amount of Influence required, you get another turn, and so on. Scoring occurs randomly twice during the game and at the end. When the first scoring occurs, only the majority holder in each Trade scores. When the second scoring occurs, the first and second majority holders score, and at the final scoring, the first three majority holders score. Ties are split accordingly.&#10;&#10;Other versions/re-themes:&#10;Alhambra Bonn card game is Alhambra the card game with the Bonn theme.

Category 5 and many other names, you want to score as few points as possible.&#10;&#10;To play the game, you shuffle the 104 number cards, lay out four cards face-up to start the four rows, then deal ten cards to each player. Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; specifically, each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a point value. After finishing ten rounds, players tally their score and see whether the game ends. (Category 5 ends when a player has a score greater than 74, for example, while 6 nimmt! ends when someone tops 66.) When this happens, the player with the fewest points wins!&#10;&#10;6 nimmt! works with 2-10 players, and the dynamics of gameplay change the more players that you have. One variant for the game has you use 34 cards, 44 cards, 54 cards, etc. (instead of all 104 cards) when you have three, four, five, etc. number of players.

Each player receives a rack for keeping three tiles drawn from a pool of tiles, which are seven different numbers in seven different colors (28 tiles in total); however, the rack is turned away from you. When players sit in a circle, each player can see everyone else's tiles, except their own. Each turn, players draw a card with a question like, &quot;Do you see more yellow sevens or more blue sevens?&quot; which should help the others' determine their tiles.

65;375;463;"From the official website:  In the Magic game, you play the role of a planeswalker&mdash;a powerful wizard who fights other planeswalkers for glory, knowledge, and conquest. Your deck of cards represents all the weapons in your arsenal. It contains the spells you know and the creatures you can summon to fight for you.&#10;&#10;This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.  Cards are categorized as common, uncommon, rare, and mythic rare.  Players collect cards and build decks out of their collection.&#10;&#10;Players build a deck of cards and duel against an opponent's deck.  The first player to reduce his opponent to 0 life (or meet another set win condition) wins the game.&#10;&#10;Deck building is  major part of the game.  There are over 17,000 different cards from which to build your deck!&#10;&#10;Players randomly draw spells to see what they get and can play each turn.  Although this limits your choices, there is a lot of strategy in how you play those spells.  A robust list of game mechanics, including intricate rules for reactive card play called &quot;the stack,&quot; provide for rich tactics and tough choices each turn.&#10;&#10;Though traditionally a two-player duel, there are several casual and tournament formats to Magic that allow more players to play.&#10;&#10;";2;20;13;2;20;Magic: The Gathering;20;1993;"Victor Adame,Miao Aili,Randis Albion,Rob Alexander,James Allen,Dave Allsop,Scott Altmann,Ian Edward Ameling,Eric David Anderson,Chris J.

By influencing the prominent forces, building magnificent palaces, and ensuring a steady supply of commodities, the princes increase their power until the most successful has won.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to gain the most influence points. These can be obtained by building palaces and by acquiring commodities. A palace can be built after securing the support of the Vizier, the General, the Monk, the Princess, or the Grand Mogul. Commodities are gained by seizing control of a region or by retrieving them on a space where a palace has just been built.&#10;&#10;There are twelve turns with an auction for the region control and the support of the Vizier, General, Monk, Princess, and Grand Mogul, each represented by a different symbol. Players use cards in four colors to bid for the various prizes, and each player may only play one color in any given turn. During your turn you can either increase your bid by playing more cards or withdraw. When you do, you gain the reward for every symbol you have the majority of. You place palaces, gain region tiles, and increase your score accordingly. There are bonus points for connecting palaces over several regions on the map.After the final area on the board is auctioned, the player with the highest point total wins the game.&#10;&#10;This game is #3 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;";5;100;12;3;75;Taj Mahal;100;2000;Franz Vohwinkel;Bluffing,Political;Reiner Knizia;Alea Big Box,Asian Theme,Country: India;Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Hand Management,Route/Network Building,Set Collection;alea,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH,ABACUSSPIELE,Quined White Goblin Games,Rio Grande Games,Ystari Games;7.33569;6220;taj mahal;33;0.0;0.0;3.5125;0;0.1;6DNpI5e8Bd;False;0;5.0;90.0;12.0;2.0;45.0;Taj Mahal;62;2-5;177;45-90;45.0;0.0;50.99;0.0;993;2000.0;taj mahal

In 2008, Avalon Hill released a 50th anniversary edition with a new map and cardboard pieces representing the armies and navies.&#10;&#10;In the game, players represent one of the seven &quot;Great Powers of Europe&quot; (Great Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, Italy, Russia or Turkey) in the years prior to World War I. Play begins in the Spring of 1901, and players make both Spring and Autumn moves each year. There are only two kinds of military units: armies and fleets. On any given turn, each of your military units has limited options: they can move into an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in an attack on an adjoining territory, support an allied unit in defending an adjoining territory, or hold their position. Players instruct each of their units by writing a set of &quot;orders.&quot; The outcome of each turn is determined by the rules of the game. There are no dice rolls or other elements of chance. With its incredibly simplistic movement mechanics fused to a significant negotiation element, this system is highly respected by many gamers.&#10;&#10;Avalon Hill Complexity rating - 3&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;    Colonial Diplomacy&#10;    Diplomacy: Classical Variant&#10;    Diplomacy: Hundred Variant&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";7;360;12;2;360;Diplomacy;360;1959;Blake Beasley,Hugh Bredin,Vincent Dutrait,Gilles Lautussier,Guillaume Rohmer,Allison Shinkle;Bluffing,Negotiation,Political,Post-Napoleonic,Wargame;Allan B.

Plastic pigs are placed on a track made from cards laid in a circle, and then players are given cards in the colors of the pigs.  Each turn, a player selects a card, and moves the corresponding pig one space forward.  If the space in front is occupied by another pig, then the moving pig 'leapfrogs' that, and this can continue until the pig takes the lead, which gives the active player a food card.  Play goes on like this until all cards for the round have been played, however in order to keep the food (points) you collect during a round, your final movement for the round must score some more food.&#10;&#10;Ages 6 and up&#10;&#10;";5;30;6;2;30;Galloping Pigs;30;1992;Iskender Gider,Franz Vohwinkel;Animals,Card Game,Children's Game;Heinz Meister;Animals: Pigs;;ABACUSSPIELE,HomoLudicus,Oya,PS-Games,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH,Red Glove,Rio Grande Games,Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.;5.7187800000000015;863;galloping pigs;3;0.0;0.0;2.8571428571428568;0;0.0;H5oSQX5Bio;False;0;4.0;30.0;6.0;2.0;20.0;Galloping Pigs;7;2-4;12;20-30;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;124;1992.0;galloping pigs

The track itself has bottlenecks and lane-changing restrictions, which make the race interesting for the racers (very similar to Detroit-Cleveland Grand Prix or Daytona 500). Players are required to race three laps, and they must stop to 'Hail Caesar' before they can finish (a pit stop). The game is light, but if you waste too many moves taking the longer, outside-routes on corners, you may not have enough movement to finish the race. Later, the game was revamped into Ausgebremst, with the most notable changes being modular boards and options to reduce the luck.&#10;&#10;The new Cafe Games/Pro Ludo edition has only 2 different tracks compared to the Ravensburger edition with 2 track variants on both sides of the board.&#10;&#10;";6;30;12;2;30;Ave Caesar;30;1989;Ingrid Berner,Eckhard Freytag,Thomas Thiemeyer;Ancient,Racing;Wolfgang Riedesser;Ancient Rome;Hand Management;Asmodee,Cafe Games,Grow Jogos e Brinquedos,Japon Brand,Man-indo,Möbius Games,Otto Maier Verlag,Pro Ludo,Ravensburger Buchverlag,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH,Ubik;6.6391100000000005;3826;ave caesar;42;0.0;0.0;3.3400000000000007;0;0.0;19DAgGmSNK;True;0;6.0;30.0;12.0;2.0;30.0;Ave Caesar;40;2-6;194;30;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;398;1989.0;ave caesar

The desert is still treacherous, mysterious, and without mercy. But for those willing to risk the dangers of the shifting, sun-baked sands, the desert holds riches beyond compare.&#10; In Through the Desert, two to five players each control a tribe of nomads vying for control of the desert. By establishing caravans and taking over oases, the players gain points as their tribes increase in power.&#10; Strategy is essential in deciding how and where to build your tribe's caravans. There are multiple ways to gain points and several ways to win. Should you try to build the longest caravan? Or should you dominate the desert's oases? Don't forget to keep an eye on your opponents' caravans, or you may find your own tribe cut off from valuable water holes.&#10;&#10;Through the Desert is part of the so called Knizia tile-laying trilogy.&#10;&#10;";5;45;10;2;45;Through the Desert;45;1998;John Gravato,Scott Nicely,Brian Schomburg,Claus Stephan;Abstract Strategy,Animals,Arabian;Reiner Knizia;Animals: Camels,Desert Theme,Fantasy Flight Silver Line Games,Knizia tile-laying trilogy;Area Enclosure,Route/Network Building;Delta Vision Publishing,Edge Entertainment,Fantasy Flight Games,Galakta,Hobby Japan,KOSMOS,Lautapelit.fi,PS-Games,Silver Stars Publishing,Wargames Club Publishing;7.04787;10553;through the desert;12;0.0;0.0;3.4844366197183096;0;0.0;BlcdRRfSEy;False;12;5.0;90.0;14.0;2.0;60.0;Through the Desert;142;2-5;483;60-90;44.99;64.99;0.0;0.0;1523;1998.0;through the desert

73;440;552;"Prior to Essen 1999, a group of students created Splotter Spellen to sell some of their own game designs.  This game is regarded as one of the highlights of that group.  The object of the game is to deliver as many people to their destinations as you can.  To accomplish this, players place route markers on the board to connect passengers to their destinations.  However, the destination types (work, bar, home) vary from turn to turn, so you can follow certain passengers as they make their way through the daily grind.&#10;&#10;Players may buy more buses (they start off with one), build onto their bus route, bring new passengers to the city (via the trains), expand the city by adding more buildings, and run their buses. There is another option, the clock, but more on that later. The action board has one other clever feature. On some actions, route expansion and building, the first player to choose that action actually gets to execute the action last! Which leads to some interesting games of chicken and some painful decisions.&#10;&#10;Buying more buses allows a player to carry one more passenger every time they run their buses - hence scoring, in the best case, one more point. Depending on how the city gets built, however, finding lots of passengers on the street can be tricky.&#10;&#10;Bus routes extend from either end of a Settlers-style initial placement. Extensions are appended to either end. Routes may only run parallel if a route is completely blocked at both ends - seems pretty rare - so getting one end pinched off can be painful (but isn't it always?). All new passengers will arrive at one of two train stations so that is one concern when route building. One must also be careful to run by a nice mix of building types. And, when building, one must always have an eye towards spoiling other players' routes by placing a mix of building types at each of their intersection so that all of their passengers just walk! Finally, when carrying passengers, one wants to be careful to set up to carry the same passenger next turn.&#10;&#10;";5;120;14;3;120;Bus;120;1999;Herman Haverkort,Tamara Jannink,Joris Wiersinga;Transportation;Jeroen Doumen,Joris Wiersinga;;Pick-up and Deliver,Worker Placement;Splotter Spellen;6.8486;653;bus;17;0.0;0.0;3.7916666666666665;0;-1.62;PYBOA9k4tg;False;0;5.0;120.0;14.0;3.0;120.0;Bus;36;3-5;175;120;235.4;119.99;120.95;0.0;2815;1999.0;bus
74;447;559;"Similar to Streetcar, Tsuro, Tantrix and Spaghetti Junction, this game has players putting square tiles onto the board to form rail lines. The major difference in this game, however, is that players are not striving to make short, direct routes like those sought in Streetcar. Instead, the object of the game is to make the rail lines as long as possible.  Players start with a number of trains ringing the board.  Whenever a tile placement connects a train to a station (either on the edge or the center of the board), that train is removed and the player scores one point for each tile that the route crosses, which can cause one tile to score multiple times if the track loops around.  However, players score double for city connections, which are the stations in the center of the board.&#10;&#10;The game was originally issued as Iron Horse (not to be confused with Iron Horse).&#10;&#10;Re-implemented by:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Cable Car&#10;&#10;&#10;";6;30;8;2;30;Metro;30;1997;Dirk Henn,Barbara Henn,Franz Vohwinkel;Trains;Dirk Henn;Cities: Paris (France),Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Mensa Select;Route/Network Building,Tile Placement;Queen Games,db-Spiele,G3,Überplay;6.36559;4608;metro;29;0.0;0.0;2.9302325581395334;0;0.51;HCkSHoY4uR;False;9;6.0;45.0;8.0;2.0;30.0;Metro;43;2-6;176;30-45;19.75;49.99;27.99;0.0;613;1997.0;metro
75;449;562;"Players manage a set of dwarves mining for gems to fulfill randomly distributed contracts.  Each turn, players simultaneously decide where to send their dwarves.  Four of the dwarves are simply miners and will mine a particular color of gem, depending on placement.  Gem prices are set each round, cheaper the more dwarves that are mining it.  Players also have two boss dwarves, which can either be shadow dwarves (used to carry out evil actions on other players), or silver dwarves (usually beneficial actions for the player).  Assembling the correct assortment of gems and assigning a silver dwarf to fulfill a contract, he can score either his own contract or one of two open contracts.

77;468;594;"In Sleuth, a classic deduction game from master designer Sid Sackson originally released as part of the 3M Gamette Series, players are searching for a hidden gem, one of 36 gem cards hidden before the start of the game. The remainder of this gem deck &ndash; with each card showing 1-3 diamonds, pearls or opals in one of four colors &ndash; is distributed evenly among the players, with any remaining cards laid face up. Thus, you and everyone else starts with some information about what's not missing.&#10;&#10;A second deck contains 54 search cards, each showing one or two elements, such as diamonds, pairs, blue opals, red pearls, or an element of your choice. Each player receives four face-up search cards; on a turn, you choose one of those cards and ask an opponent how many gem cards they have of the type shown. If you ask for, say, pairs, the player must tell you how many pairs they hold but not which specific pairs; if you ask for something more specific, say, red diamonds, the player reveals to everyone how many such cards she holds while you get to look at them in secret.&#10;&#10;Players track information on a score pad. You can guess the hidden gem at any time, or on your turn you can ask any one question regardless of which search cards you have, then immediately make a guess by marking your sheet and checking the hidden gem card. If you're wrong, you keep playing but can only answer questions; if you're correct, you win.&#10;&#10;The simplicity of the rules and the cards belies the complexity of the game. In some cases you see cards, while in others you hear only the number of cards that an opponent holds, making it tough to deduce.

The outer lane is a passing lane, requiring twice as many movement points to use and in which a car may not end its turn.  Movement points come from play of the special deck of cards.  Selecting a card from your hand, you move each of the cars on the card the prescribed number of spaces, trying to position your own car or cars most advantageously while leaving your opponents blocked.

89;643;859;"Illuminati is a classic Steve Jackson (I) game of world domination. Each player takes on the role of a secret society attempting to spread its tendrils into special interest groups throughout the world.&#10;&#10;The game consists of three different cards (illuminati cards, group cards, and special event cards) and money. During a player's turn, a new card is drawn from a deck containing both group cards and special event cards. If it is a special event, the player in turn keeps the card and plays it when desired. If it is a group card, it is turned up along with any other face-up cards. The player in turn may then attempt to take over any group. This can be either a group on the table or a group already controlled by another player. If another player already controls the group it is more difficult to take it over, but not impossible.&#10;&#10;How difficult it is to take over a group depends on the strength of the controlling group, the resistance of the group being taken over, the proximity of the group being taken over to the controlling player's illuminati card (if someone already controls it), and other factors. Once this is determined, both the attacking and defending player can modify the odds further by spending &quot;megabucks&quot;. Once a group is taken over, it has to be attached to the card structure the player already controls. How cards can be attached to each other is limited by in- and outbound arrows on the cards, and maintaining a well-structured tree of groups can be vital to success.&#10;&#10;The winning condition for each player is different and depends on what illuminati card that player has.&#10;&#10;This first edition contains 54 small black and white cards.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 1&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 2&#10;    Illuminati Expansion Set 3&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Re-published as:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati:  Deluxe Edition&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;CCG Version:&#10;&#10;    Illuminati: New World Order&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Magazine Articles:&#10;&#10;    Imagine (Issue 6 - Sep 1983)&#10;        European Illuminati - New cards.&#10;    &#10;    The Space Gamer (Issue 59 - Jan 1983)&#10;        Illuminating the Post Office - Converting six groups to Illuminati.&#10;    &#10;    Space Gamer (Issue 72 - Jan 1985)&#10;        Death to Deadheads! - Variant rules for Illuminati, The Evil Geniuses Are Here! - Variant new cards for Illuminati, More Groups Illuminated! - A couple more illuminated groups for Illuminati, The Monty Python Illuminati - The British Illuminati, 24 groups, and 3 special cards with a Monty Python theme.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";6;120;12;2;60;Illuminati;120;1982;Jeffrey D.

90;645;864;"WizKids' first game, Mage Knight cleverly applies the CCG concept to miniatures; a &quot;Starter Pack&quot; contains 10 random pre-painted, plastic miniatures, while &quot;Booster Packs&quot; contain 5. Figures' stats are kept track of via dials on their bases, which change depending on how much damage they've taken.&#10;&#10;As in most miniatures games, players each create an army with the same number of points (with each miniature having a different point value), then take turns moving and attacking until all of the opponent's forces are dead or captured, the opponent withdraws, or your pre-determined time limit expires.&#10;&#10;The same figures could be used in two other games:&#10;&#10;    Mage Knight Conquest&#10;    Mage Knight Dungeons&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";4;60;10;2;60;Mage Knight;60;2000;Sandra Garavito,Bob Naismith;Collectible Components,Fantasy,Miniatures,Wargame;Kevin Barrett,Jordan Weisman;Clix,CMGs (Collectible Miniatures Games),Mage Knight Universe;;Kadokawa Shoten,WizKids;6.06762;874;mage knight;21;0.0;0.0;3.2;0;0.0;xiKYBCtwVT;False;0;4.0;60.0;10.0;2.0;60.0;Mage Knight;10;2-4;5;60;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;153;2000.0;mage knight
91;653;875;"In Roads &amp; Boats, players start with a modest collection of donkeys, geese, boards, and stone. With these few materials, players work to develop their civilization. The emphasis in the game is logistical transport as you bring goods to producers to make new goods. But beware, the only thing you own is what is on your transporters, and anyone can use any production facility, or pick up any goods left behind.&#10;&#10;In more detail, this massive set of pieces looks more like a modular game kit than anything else. You get a ton of Settlers-sized hexes in a number of colors for terrain type; hundreds of little counters for the commodities that are produced and the locations where they're produced; wooden disks for all of the donkeys, rafts, trucks, and other forms of transportation you can use; and a roll of acrylic with an erasable marker. The tiles are laid out in whatever scenario you wish to play, and then the clear plastic is taped over the top to secure the entire board. Roads and bridges are drawn on the plastic and chits are placed in the hexes to form the playing surface. The idea is that your transportation units (at first, a fleet of donkeys) travel about and pick items that part produced. However, the only thing that you own is that which is carried by your transports. So you might have a nice, shiny, new truck factory or a gold-filled mine, but anyone can use it or take it, if they collect the necessary components and can transport them to the factory. The ultimate goal is to collect wealth, which is progressively more valuable and harder to manufacture: gold, coins, or stock certificates; and also contribute to the game timer in the form of monument blocks for victory points.&#10;&#10;";4;240;14;1;240;Roads & Boats;240;1999;Herman Haverkort,Tamara Jannink;City Building,Civilization,Economic,Industry / Manufacturing,Transportation;Jeroen Doumen,Joris Wiersinga;Solitaire Games;Grid Movement,Line Drawing,Modular Board,Pick-up and Deliver,Route/Network Building;Splotter Spellen;7.76255;2485;roads & boats;57;0.0;0.0;4.04054054054054;0;0.2;lbzzasNAGG;True;0;4.0;300.0;12.0;1.0;240.0;Roads & Boats;37;1-4;176;240-300;139.95;0.0;0.0;0.0;704;1999.0;roads & boats

96;693;943;"In Ligretto, each player has his own deck of forty cards, with cards 1-10 in four colors and a unique symbol on the back to identify which cards are his. At the start of each round, each player lays out 3-5 cards (depending on the number of players) face up in front of him to create his row; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to his row to create his Ligretto stack; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.&#10;&#10;Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty his Ligretto stack. If he has a 1 on the top of any face-up stack, he plays it to the center of the table. If he has a 2 of the same color as any 1 in the center of the table, he can place the 2 on the 1. All cards in the central piles must be played in ascending order and must be the same color.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, he can reveal cards from the stack in his hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card. He can play this top card onto a central pile as long as he meets the rules for doing so.&#10;&#10;As soon as a player empties his Ligretto stack, the round ends. Each player scores 1 point for each of his cards among the central piles, then loses 2 points for each card remaining in his Ligretto stack. In some versions of the game, the player with the highest score wins; in other versions, players then sort all the cards and play another round, with the first player to reach 99 points winning.&#10;&#10;A rules variant for Ligretto allows a player to play cards from his Ligretto stack or the cards in hand onto the cards in his row, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the colors of adjacent cards are not identical.&#10;&#10;";4;10;8;2;10;Ligretto;10;1988;Michael Michaels;Card Game,Real-time;Michael Michaels;Ligretto;Pattern Building;ADC Blackfire Entertainment,Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd,Playroom Entertainment,Rosengarten,Schmidt Spiele,Tactic;6.20476;2336;ligretto;64;0.0;0.0;2.5;0;0.09;NslswGRMdu;False;0;4.0;10.0;8.0;2.0;10.0;Ligretto;12;2-4;104;10;10.95;20.0;15.95;7.15;113;1988.0;ligretto

Each player will be dealt a hand of cards (consisting of 5 types corresponding to the above tribes).  Players themselves are represented by stone figures.  Temple cards will be made available at the side of the board for building throughout the game.  On his or her turn, a player may discard a card to move to the corresponding region, place a card on the region they are currently located, build a temple by having tribesmen equal to the number or level on the temple card AND having built the previous (lower) temple level, move tribesmen from one region to another, or perform a skill action unique to each tribe.  Players may perform any and all actions available to them, being able to perform most actions as many times as they wish and saving any number of unplayed cards for subsequent turns.&#10;&#10;A big component of this game is placing your tribe cards in sets. Skills can only be used if a set of three (or more) cards is at the same location as the player marker.  By discarding one of the cards of a set, the skill may be used.  No matter the tribe, performing this action can force the opponent to discard half their hand.  Other skills, such as robbing a temple from an opponent, skipping a level on a temple build, destroy an opposing temple, etc. are specific to the tribe activated.&#10;&#10;Game play progresses until one of two conditions is met: if a player builds 15 points (or levels) of temples before the opposing player builds at least 10 points, that player wins.  If the opponent [i]does have[/i] more than 10 points, the game continues until one player reaches 20 points (in which case he or she wins) OR one player subsequently drops below 10 (in which case he or she loses).&#10;&#10;";2;60;12;2;45;Babel;60;2000;Chris Quilliams,Claus Schobig;Ancient,Card Game,City Building;Hagen Dorgathen,Uwe Rosenberg;Kosmos two-player series;Hand Management,Set Collection;999 Games,Filosofia Éditions,KOSMOS,Rio Grande Games,Tilsit,White Goblin Games,Z-Man Games;6.70869;3212;babel;40;0.0;0.0;3.2104166666666663;0;0.0;sedUGoL6oF;False;0;2.0;60.0;10.0;2.0;45.0;Babel;40;2;93;45-60;0.0;24.99;0.0;21.39;327;2000.0;babel

If the player does this, he claims the treasure card and a new card is revealed; if not, play continues until someone grabs that treasure.&#10;&#10;Once all the treasure has been collected, the game ends and whoever nabbed the most treasure wins!&#10;&#10;";4;15;5;2;15;Junior Labyrinth;15;1995;Paul Windle;Children's Game,Fantasy,Maze,Racing;Max J.

105;822;1219;"Labyrinth (formerly The aMAZEing Labyrinth) has spawned a whole line of Labyrinth games. The game board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles that make up the labyrinth slide in and out of the rows created by the tiles that are locked in place. One tile always remains outside the labyrinth, and players take turns taking this extra tile and sliding it into a row of the labyrinth, moving all those tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board; this newly removed tile becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.&#10;&#10;Players move around the shifting paths of the labyrinth in a race to collect various treasures. Whoever collects all of his treasures first and returns to his home space wins!&#10;&#10;Labyrinth is simple at first glance and an excellent puzzle-solving game for children; it can also be played by adults using more strategy and more of a cutthroat approach.&#10;&#10;";4;20;8;2;20;Labyrinth;20;1986;Stephen Hillenburg,illuVision,Max J.

A player may pay a certain number of 'beans' to refuse a block and it gets passed to the next player.  When a player's structure falls, they are out of the game.  Last player standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Bandu (1992, Milton Bradley, 2-6 players):&#10;Bandu is based upon the game of Bausack. Each player is given a base block and a number of beans. During a turn, a player chooses a wood block from a common supply and either holds a Refuse or Use auction. All player bid with their beans and the winner/loser must place the piece on their tower. If your tower falls you are out of the game. The last tower standing wins.&#10;&#10;Description of Sac Noir (Rio Grande Games, 2-8 players):&#10;There are five variations on how to play. The goal in all of them is to build a tower. The bag contains very different wooden pieces (i.e. an ashlar, an egg, a ring, a fir tree etc.) as well as a sack of beans for the &quot;auction variation&quot; of the game. Depending on the variation you choose, either each player builds his own tower or all build one together. The &quot;auction variations&quot; are the most suspenseful and surprising. One might end up spending quite some beans to avoid building an especially difficult element. Gambling and bluffing abilities are needed just as much as a feeling for statics and construction skills. It's a game with almost endless building possibilities. It's a challenge for steady hands and shaky suspense for clever tacticians.&#10;&#10;";8;45;7;2;15;Bausack;45;1987;Olivia Schuff;Action / Dexterity;Klaus Zoch;3D Games;Auction/Bidding;Competo / Marektoy,Giochi Uniti,Lord Carter,Milton Bradley,Vennerød Forlag AS,Zoch Verlag;6.88224;3290;bausack;62;0.0;0.0;3.119565217391304;0;0.0;q8b4gohJ9M;False;0;8.0;45.0;8.0;2.0;15.0;Bausack;46;2-8;160;15-45;0.0;0.0;59.95;0.0;673;1987.0;bausack

Cards are arrayed on a flat surface between the two players.  Location cards are laid out first and then characters or ships are laid out at the locations.  Additional types of cards can be placed on ships and characters, for example weapons and devices. The object of the game is to drain your opponent's life force.  Each card represents a unit of life force.  Playing location cards allows you to draw additional life force into your hand.  If a ship or character is destroyed in battle, the card goes to a lost pile; when all cards are in your lost pile you have lost the game.&#10;&#10;This is a strategy based card game set in the Star Wars universe that can become very addictive.

114;867;1301;"Netrunner is a cyberpunk-themed collectible card game.  The two players are the Corp (who wins by completing Agendas) and the Runner (who wins by infiltrating the Corp and liberating Agendas).&#10;&#10;Each side has a limited number of both actions and bits (money) to spend per turn; bits are gone once used, and actions must be spent to gain more.&#10;An important thing when evaluating the power of cards is to see the Bit per action ratio.&#10;&#10;One unique feature of this game is that the Runner physically moves on the &quot;board&quot; created by facedown Corp cards.  It has the feel of a &quot;capture the flag&quot; game, with the Runner moving in dataforts to steal Agendas from the Corp.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature is that the Cards are NOT the primary strategy of the game; in fact, players can win by simply &quot;playing with the rules&quot; itself (a concept difficult to understand if you've never played Netrunner).&#10;&#10;Both players play as both Corp and Runner in a game, one after the other, with each player's Runner going against the opponent's Corp.  A winning match provides 10 points and the loser scores points equal to the number of agenda points scored/liberated. The winner of the game is the one who has the most points in the 2 submatches.&#10;&#10;Though Netrunner is traditionally a two-player duel, there are formats that allow for more players (called &quot;The Big Sell Out&quot;).&#10;&#10;Richard Garfield himself considered Netrunner as his best boardgame design instead of CCG design game, and he loves games that include bluffing mechanics; with Netrunner, bluffing is an integral part of the game.&#10;&#10;When it was released in 1996, many gaming magazines gave Netrunner critical acclaim as the best CCG ever designed.

In round 3, the cluegiver can use no words at all and can pass as often as he likes; again, teammates are allowed only a single guess.

117;922;1382;"A lively game of horse racing where players bet on several of seven horses to try to gain the most money by the end of the game.&#10;&#10;A re-issue by Alea of Knizia's Turf Horse Racing published by Gibsons Games. This edition has better graphics and uses the same mechanism of 4 symbols on the horse cards also appearing on the die. Players roll the die and choose which horse you want to move from those not taken their turn yet. The seven horses vary in strength, but even the weakest horses have some amazing bursts of speed. Players bet on the horses before each race and so either co-operate or compete to get their horses over the line. There are money tokens now for the winners, but not enough supplied in the game to pay out properly.&#10;&#10;There are various differences between this edition and THR. There are only 3 races instead of 4. The circuit is oval, the horses start in a line of seven places, not all together. In the race, they cannot share spaces so a horse can only move to the next available empty space. This can make it easy to block the ones at the back and it's nearly possible to lap the final horse, or end the race before it's even crossed the start line. I've never seen a horse race where they start nose to tail!&#10;&#10;There is a variant where the betting is done secretly with players using a 0 betting chip (for bluffing) in addition to the 2,1 and 1 betting chips of the basic game.  There's also a sprint bonus in the race and a penalty for the last horse.&#10;&#10;Republished by Face 2 Face Games as &quot;Winner's Circle&quot; in 2006.&#10;&#10;&quot;Royal Turf&quot; is #2 in the Alea small box series.&#10;&#10;";6;60;10;2;45;Winner's Circle;60;2001;William O'Connor,U#,Franz Vohwinkel;Animals,Racing,Sports;Reiner Knizia;Alea Small Box,Sports: Horse Racing;Betting/Wagering,Roll / Spin and Move;alea,DiceTree Games,Ediciones MasQueOca,Face2Face Games,Group SNE,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH,Smart Ltd;6.96328;4131;winner's circle;48;0.0;0.0;3.3535087719298247;0;0.0;uGMmnnJnZo;True;0;6.0;60.0;10.0;2.0;45.0;Winner's Circle;57;2-6;202;45-60;175.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;711;2001.0;winner's circle

Another scoring deck of 24 has values of 1-12; two cards from this deck are laid face up.&#10;&#10;Players choose one card from their hand in secret and reveal them simultaneously. The highest value played takes the lowest scoring card, which goes face-up to a pile in front of you. The second highest takes the other card likewise. Remaining cards are discounted. Then look at everyone's face-up deck: the highest scoring player turns one of his or her marker cards over! (The original game had cockatoos becoming cuckoos; this edition is themed on lifesavers). At the end of a round, players score according to their markers cards that they managed to save (cockatoos or life-savers).&#10;&#10;There is a further twist! Players then pick up all their playing hand, and pass it clockwise. So as each round commences, you are using the cards previously used by your neighbor! Are you smarter?

119;964;1447;"1841 is the apex (or nadir depending on your point of view) of 18xx stock-market manipulation. Set in Northern Italy during a period of rapid political change (borders for playable hexes change twice during the course of the game) the game is one of the most difficult even for experienced 18xx players.&#10;&#10;The greatest innovations center on the ability of companies to own shares in other public companies and the merging of companies. Train obsolescence is rapid and unforgiving, and it is quite possible for forced-purchase trains to be obsolete before they get a chance to run. Capitalization is on a per-share basis throughout the game and train prices are steep &gt;1400 for an 8 train - the largest.&#10;&#10;There are 8 historical corporations and eight, named but ahistorical &quot;generic&quot; corporations. These are normally used simply as investment vehicles to maximize the amount of capital available to &quot;successful&quot; companies close to Milan. Northern Italy is mountainous, especially near the off-board Alpine areas and to the South of the map, making progress slow and expensive for the outlying historical companies.&#10;&#10;1841 has a reputation as a very long game, but is not necessarily much longer than games, such as 1870, which have a very large bank. It can be completed in four hours.&#10;&#10;Chris Lawson's game kit is one version that is available and is of his usual high (for a game kit) quality. A large amount of time with scissors and craft knife to cut out the stock and tiles can be expected.  Deep Thought Games now publishes 1841v2 which incorporates changes by Manlio Manzini to address some of the perceived shortcomings with the original which was designed by Federico Vellani with Manlio as a co-author.&#10;&#10;Description by Steve Thomas:&#10;&#10;1841 is the 18xx game of choice for many players, though some hate it. Designed, and originally published as 1839 by Federico Vellani, it is set in northern Italy. The McGuffin here is that 1841 is the 18xx game which is least about actually building a railway and most about manipulating the stock market and managing the extremely fierce train obsolescence. Route development has its place, but unless the players can get the rest of the game about right they are doomed, and it is this which polarizes players' views of the game. When it first became available it whetted the slightly jaded palates of some players since the dividing line between success and abject failure is so narrow. 1841 achieves this by allowing companies to buy and sell shares in each other, and to merge with one another. These factors result in frequent and hard-to-predict changes to the order in which the companies operate. It's exciting and dynamic, and the only real downside, at least for &quot;the financiers who've had enough of the engineers&quot;, to misquote the 1853 box art, is the length of the game. At typically seven hours it cannot sensibly be played in an evening. Even so, the game is usually well worth the investment of time, though it's certainly not for the novice.&#10;&#10;";8;300;14;2;300;1841;300;1994;;Economic,Trains,Transportation;Manlio Manzini,Federico Vellani;18xx,Cities: Bologna,Cities: Ferrara,Cities: Florence,Cities: Genova,Cities: Mantova,Cities: Milan,Cities: Ravenna (Italy),Cities: Torino,Cities: Venice,Country: Italy;Route/Network Building,Stock Holding,Tile Placement;Chris Lawson,Deep Thought Games, LLC;7.7427199999999985;180;1841;13;0.0;0.0;3.4;0;0.0;CpHWBRMSAV;False;0;8.0;300.0;14.0;2.0;300.0;1841;5;2-8;12;300;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;127;1994.0;1841
120;973;1465;"The trick-taking game Wizard uses a sixty-card deck that consists of the traditional 52-card deck (1-13 in four suits) along with four Wizards (high) and four Jesters (low).&#10;&#10;Players compete over multiple rounds based on the number of players, and whoever ends with the highest score wins. In each round, players are dealt a hand of cards &mdash; one card in the first round, two cards in the second, three in the third, etc. &mdash; then trump is determined by flipping the top card of the undealt deck; if a suit is revealed, that suit is trump, while if a Wizard or Jester (or no card in the final round) is revealed, then the round has no trump. Players then state how many tricks they expect to win in the round.&#10;&#10;The playing and winning of the tricks uses mostly standard trick-taking rules. If a player leads a suited card, then all other players must follow suit, if possible. If a player leads a Jester, then the second player determines the suit led. If a player leads a Wizard, then those who follow can play whatever they want. However, in all cases a player may always play a Wizard or Jester, even if they hold cards in the suit led.&#10;&#10;After each player has played a card, determine the winner of the trick as follows: If one or more Wizards were played, the player of the first Wizard wins the trick, collects the cards, and leads to the next trick. If not, whoever played the highest trump wins the trick. If not, whoever played the highest card of the suit led wins the trick. If all players played Jesters, whoever played the first Jester wins.&#10;&#10;After all tricks have been played, players tally their score for the round. If a player matched their bid, winning exactly as many tricks as stated at the start of the round, they score 20 points, plus 10 points for each trick taken. If a player missed their bid, they lose 10 points for each trick that they were off, whether they took more or fewer than predicted.&#10;&#10;A common variant in Wizard is to not allow the total number of tricks bid in a round to match the round number, thereby forcing (at least) one player to be off each round.&#10;&#10;";6;45;10;3;45;Wizard;45;1984;Franz Vohwinkel;Card Game;Ken Fisher;Wizard;Betting/Wagering,Hand Management,Trick-taking;(Unknown),999 Games,AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH,Canada Games,Copag - Cia.

The set collection aspect of rummy is basically the same, with groups of three cards in either runs or denominations making a valid meld. The twist is that in each hand the number of cards required to create a meld increases, from three cards in the first hand to thirteen in the last. The game, therefore, consists of eleven hands.&#10;&#10;In each hand, in addition to the six Jokers, other cards are designated as wild: in the first hand 3s are wild; in the second hand 4s are wild, and so on until in the last hand the Kings go wild.

125;1006;1515;"Players take turns forming words on either an 8x8 matrix gameboard (in the current new classic version offered by Winning Moves) or on a 10x10 matrix gameboard (in the currently offered Hasbro Euro edition). Words may be formed horizontally or vertically on the grid, as in Scrabble, but as the title suggests the letters may also be stacked, so already-played words can be changed into different words by having letters stacked (up to a limit of 5 high). EXAMPLE: Change LATE to CATER and then change CATER to BELATED. Scoring is different from Scrabble; there are no prescribed letter values per tile; instead, when a new word is formed, the number of tiles used in that word is counted and used as the score as follows: A word that is flat (no stacked tiles) scores 2 points per tile, but the words that score the most are those that have many stacked tiles, with tiles underneath the spelled word also being counted.

127;1045;1574;"The hobby of wargaming was born in the 1950s with the publication of the game Tactics. TACTICS II is a direct descendant of this original board wargame.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II is sort of like military chess. Different pieces, called &quot;units&quot; in wargames, have different capabilities just like chess pieces. The major difference is that a player can move all his pieces each turn, and after all his pieces are moved, battles are resolved against the enemy units his pieces are next to (adjacent to).&#10;&#10;The other major difference between wargames and chess is that wargames have a mapboard, divided into squares or hexagons for movement purposes. TACTICS II has a 22&quot; x 28&quot; mapboard portraying a fictional continent with two countries, Blue and Red. Terrain includes roads, rivers, woods, mountains, beaches, and cities. The Blue Capital can only be reached over a vast plain, bordered on the left by mountains and on the right by woods. The Red Capital is on an island and can only be reached across one of several bridges or by an amphibious invasion.&#10;&#10;Game features include special functions for headquarters units, terrain effects, invasions, airborne assaults, weather effects, replacements, isolation, and even nuclear weapons. Units represent infantry, armor, mountain, airborne, headquarters, and amphibious troops. Over 100 counters in all.&#10;&#10;TACTICS II was almost always part of the Avalon Hill game line, primarily because it was sold as an introductory wargame for a number of reasons. The rules introduced many basic board wargaming concepts and were relatively low in complexity. The rulebook is divided into a basic game and a tournament game (advanced game). Both are balanced and relatively quick playing. As the opposing armies are identical in size and composition, victory is gained by a combination of logic, foresight, luck, common sense, and skill in military strategy and tactics.&#10;&#10;In 1981, an unauthorized hex map version, called Opera&#195;&#167;&#195;&#163;o MX-1, was released in Brazil.

128;1057;1588;"The theme of this game is building sheep farms. Each farmer (player) owns a farm consisting of hexes radiating out from the center of the board, and whose boundaries (and therefore, sizes) are initially undefined. The placement of fences -- each of which is shared by the two surrounding farms -- defines the boundaries. Some hexes are clearly going to be in certain farms; others will be fought over (either to acquire or avoid!) fiercely.&#10;&#10;The goal is to complete one's own farm by having the fences on both its sides reach the outer edge of the board before the game ends (without which one cannot win), and to have the most enclosed points among all such completed farms (which wins).&#10;&#10;The sheep are on thick cardboard disks, printed on one side with values ranging from 5 (the best) down to -3. One sheep can fit onto each board hex.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player gets to do one of several actions:&#10;&#10;1) place a sheep blindly from the supply face-down onto an empty board space after secretly looking at it; 2) turn up a face-down sheep tile in place (thereby freezing it for the rest of the game); 3) use the cool wooden sheepdog to blindly &quot;herd&quot; a face-down sheep from one hex to another, where it is then flipped up and frozen; or 4) lay a fence piece on either of the two fences surrounding his farm.&#10;&#10;Certain board hexes, symmetrically distributed, act as multipliers for the sheep that ends up in that space.  There are a few special situation rules and a few rules governing fence placement. There are strong elements of bluff and memory in this game.&#10;&#10;The game ends when one player's completed farm is filled with pieces (either face-up or down sheep, or the dog). Whoever has the highest number of points on face-up sheep in his/her farm after applying multipliers is the winner.&#10;&#10;";6;45;8;2;45;Bauernschlau;45;1991;;Farming,Memory;Tom Schoeps;Animals: Sheep;Secret Unit Deployment;Dal Negro,F.X.

The heroes try to figure out Who killed the Archmage, Where the crime occurred, and Which magical weapon was used.&#10;&#10;For the most part, gameplay in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is identical to standard Clue as players roll a die, move into different locations on the game board, then make accusations against a particular combination of who/where/which cards and a particular opponent; if that opponent holds one of those cards, she must reveal it to you. Eventually someone will narrow down the possibilities and make an accusation as to exactly which cards have been removed from the game; if correct the player wins, and otherwise she's out of the game and play continues for everyone else.&#10;&#10;One optional element in Clue: Dungeons &amp; Dragons is the Wandering Monsters deck. After landing on a &quot;claw-marked&quot; space on the game board, the player draws the top card from this deck, then battles the creature shown by rolling a die. If she wins, she gains a magic item that confers a single-use special ability, such as looking at a random card from an opponent's hand or taking an extra turn. If she loses, her token is placed in the center of the game board, from where it will take several turns to move back into a room (and get back into the game).&#10;&#10;";6;90;8;2;90;Clue: Dungeons & Dragons;90;2001;;Deduction,Fantasy,Medieval,Murder/Mystery;(Uncredited);Cluedo,Dungeons & Dragons;Roll / Spin and Move;USAopoly;5.85568;220;clue: dungeons & dragons;62;0.0;0.0;3.0;0;0.0;CKK6FTOFvL;False;0;6.0;90.0;8.0;2.0;90.0;Clue: Dungeons & Dragons;5;2-6;0;90;35.95;0.0;48.95;0.0;83;2001.0;clue: dungeons & dragons

Inspired by the award-winning Ambush! solitaire game system, Open Fire provides the player with a platoon of American armor, faced with a variety of missions against an ever-changing German foe. The variable events, innumerable tactical options, and wealth of unexpected occurrences make Open Fire a game unlike any tactical armor game you have ever played before.

Set in the not-so-distant future, battles are now fought by machines of destruction, known as MODs, for short.

These come into play via the use of Command cards, which add a new dimension to the game.  Now the battle is not just for the continents, but the sea and moon are also battlegrounds.&#10;&#10;Although much has been added, the basic flavor of the game is still Risk.  One welcome change is the institution of a five-turn game limit, which allows the game to play to completion in about three hours.  Further, players must also factor in economics in the form of energy.  This energy is used to purchase command cards, bid for turn order, and hire new commanders.

Grab the treasure and run.&#10;&#10;Admit it. You love it.&#10;&#10;This award-winning card game, designed by Steve Jackson, captures the essence of the dungeon experience... with none of that stupid roleplaying stuff. You and your friends compete to kill monsters and grab magic items. And what magic items! Don the Horny Helmet and the Boots of Butt-Kicking. Wield the Staff of Napalm... or maybe the Chainsaw of Bloody Dismemberment. Start by slaughtering the Potted Plant and the Drooling Slime, and work your way up to the Plutonium Dragon...&#10;&#10;And it's illustrated by John Kovalic! Fast-playing and silly, Munchkin can reduce any roleplaying group to hysteria. And, while they're laughing, you can steal their stuff.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Other&#10;&#10;Part of the Munchkin series.&#10;&#10;Munchkin is a satirical card game based on the clich&eacute;s and oddities of Dungeons and Dragons and other role-playing games. Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels.  Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;In May 2010, Steve Jackson Games made the &quot;big announcement.&quot; Many rules and cards were changed. See The Great 2010 Munchkin Changeover for details. Of note to Munchkin fans, the Kneepads of Allure card, which had been removed in the 14th printing, was added back to the game but modified to be less powerful.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Sequels:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The Good, the Bad, and the Munchkin&#10;    Munchkin Apocalypse&#10;    Munchkin Axe Cop&#10;    Munchkin Bites!&#10;    Munchkin Booty&#10;    Munchkin Conan&#10;    Munchkin Cthulhu&#10;    Munchkin Fu&#10;    Munchkin Impossible&#10;    Munchkin Legends&#10;    Munchkin Pathfinder&#10;    Munchkin Zombies&#10;    Star Munchkin&#10;    Super Munchkin&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Related Board Games&#10;&#10;&#10;    Munchkin Quest&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Online play&#10;&#10;&#10;     Vassal does not support Munchkin anymore.

The players are Trust-Busting lawyers going about the board slapping lawsuits on the monopolies. The winning trust buster is the one who ends with the largest number of social-credit points when one of the players runs out of money.&#10;&#10;There are 3 kinds of company combinations on the board: Oligopolies, Trusts and Monopolies, marked by one, two and three &quot;accusation circles&quot; respectively. &quot;Accusing&quot; is done by placing a small, round chip of the same color as your token on such a circle. When all accusation circles of a combination are covered, the monopolistic practices of that combination have been ended. An accusation chip can be bought from the &quot;Budget-Commissioner&quot;; when lending money, he provides a Social-Credit card as an IOU.&#10;&#10;Variant rules are supplied for a Low-Budget Game and a Trading Game.&#10;&#10;Anspach fought --and won-- a vicious court battle against Hasbro (and others) over this game.&#10;&#10;Anti-Monopoly was briefly (1976-1982) published as &quot;Anti&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; was published as &quot;Choice&quot; whilst the company was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot;. In 1984 after prevailing in court the company used the names &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot; and &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot; for its two games.  In 1987, Anti-Monopoly was withdrawn and Anti-Monopoly II was renamed &quot;Anti-Monopoly&quot;.  The game described here was produced as Anti-Monopoly before 1976 and from 1984 thru 1987.  The game produced as Anti-Monopoly after 1987 is a different game, with the same name.

146;1241;1932;"In this game the players follow either the rules for monopolists or those for competitors. Competitors charge fair rents, build as soon as they own a property, place four houses (green) at the most, after which they build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to Price War. On the other hand, Monopolists extort monopoly-high rents from their poor tenants, build only after they have at least two streets of one color, restrict supply by putting only three houses on their properties, after which they also are allowed to build a hotel (red) and occasionally go to prison!&#10;&#10;The good guys are the small entrepreneurs and the bad guys are the monopolists. Since players do not play by the same rules, fairness is achieved by a win probability equalization technique (which is where the second author comes in).&#10;&#10;Competitors make more money than Monopolists in the beginning of the game but Monopolists can catch up later, especially if Competitors don't watch their money!&#10;&#10;The game was first published as &quot;Choice&quot; because Anspach was forbidden to use the word &quot;Monopoly&quot; by the courts. When that was overturned in 1983, the name was changed to &quot;Anti-Monopoly II&quot;. In 1987, believing that consumer confusion between Anti-Monopoly and Anti-Monopoly II was harming sales of the latter game, Anspach ceased the production of the original game and removed the &quot;II&quot; from the name of the latter game.&#10;&#10;";6;120;8;2;120;Anti-Monopoly II;120;1977;;Economic;Ralph Anspach;;Roll / Spin and Move,Set Collection;ASS Altenburger Spielkarten,Brand Makers International,Ferriot Cric,Gibsons Games,Granna,Kirjalito,National Games, Inc.,Talicor,Ungame,University Games;3.84284;155;anti-monopoly ii;55;0.0;0.0;2.0;0;0.0;dzXut8461l;False;0;6.0;120.0;8.0;2.0;120.0;Anti-Monopoly II;1;2-6;31;120;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;101;1977.0;anti-monopoly ii

The game is played using mostly standard trick-taking rules: Each turn, someone plays a card to the center of the table, then in turn each player lays down (if possible) a card matching the suit or rank of the card led, throwing out any other card otherwise. The highest card in the color led wins the trick, and that player leads the next trick. Points come only from the black cards, with the black spies (yes, &quot;spies&quot;, with six black #7 cards) being worth ten points each and all other black cards worth 1-5 points.

150;1309;2081;"This sprawling rendition of the American Civil War tries to fit in everything, from Grant and Lee down to Indian raids in the Western territories. It also includes the most extensive treatment of naval and riverine warfare of any strategic Civil War game. The map covers the theater of the war from the Eastern seaboard to the middle of Texas at 25 miles per hex. An optional second map extends to New Mexico. There are five turns per year, four of two months each and a four-month Winter turn. Each turn consists of an indefinite number of &quot;pulses&quot; and may last a long, long time. Troops are represented by generic Strength Points (about 5,000 men per SP, or one or two ironclads with escorting naval vessels).&#10;&#10;The key concepts in the game are Theaters, Command Points, Pulses and Leaders.&#10;&#10;&#10;     There are three Theaters: East, West and Trans-Mississippi. Players must prioritize them each turn as primary, secondary and tertiary. These designations are made a turn in advance, requiring a modest degree of foresight. Higher priority Theaters receive larger allocations of Command Points and thus will see more activity.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Command Points are needed to perform most of the game's functions, such as moving SP's, consolidating SP's into Armies, constructing fortifications, adding naval SP's, sacking unwanted generals, etc. Players obtain them by dice rolls at the start of each turn. In addition to CP's assigned to individual theaters, they receive an allotment of &quot;discretionary&quot; CP's that can be used in any Theater. The Union also gets Naval CP's. Additional CP's may be generated during a turn, as noted below.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Each turn is divided into an indefinite number of Pulses. To begin a Pulse, each player rolls two dice. The difference between the results is the number of actions each must take in that Pulse (high roller first). Actions may be used to expend Command Points, to muster SP reinforcements or to bring inew or newly promoted Leaders into play. If the dice rolls are equal, either the turn ends immediately or each player receives additional Command Points. The likelihood of an immediate end rises with the number of tied rolls and is a certainty on the fourth tie. If the turn doesn't end in this fashion, it continues until all Command Points have been used and available reinforcements and Leaders entered.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     While Strength Points are abstract, the game includes more than 60 historical Leaders, who enter play at about the time that they rose to prominence in real life. Each Leader has a rank (one to four stars) and ratings for Initiative, Tactical Combat and Army Command. Many begin at lower ranks and can be promoted. Sherman, for instance, has a single star when he appears but can rise to four. Like Presidents Lincoln and Davis in real life, players don't have absolute control over promotions, nor does every Leader perform better at a higher rank. A Leader's rank determines the number of SP's he can command - up to two for a one star, up to six for higher ranks. Assigning as many SP's as permitted to a Leader (preferably a capable one) is economical, since he can move his entire force by expending Command Points equal to his Initiative. (Lower Initiative numbers are better in this game.) Without Leaders, SP's cost one CP each to move, rendering them all but static. Better yet are Armies, which can be as large as 25 SP's and must be commanded by a three or four star Leader. (Each Army has its own maximum size, based on its historical counterpart.)&#10;&#10;&#10;The game has much more: an elaborate combat resolution procedure, somewhat less elaborate supply rules, a naval system that is a game in itself, cavalry, railroads, militia, neutral states and a chrome-laden option to add the Far West map and Theater.&#10;&#10;Players gain Victory Points primarily by capturing major enemy and neutral cities and winning neutral states to their side. The South also gets VP's for successful commerce raiding and for isolating or capturing Washington, D.C. It wins at once if it captures Washington at a moment when it has more VP's than the North. Otherwise, VP's are checked in November 1864 and April 1865, when the game comes to a definitive end.&#10;&#10;For those who lack time or patience for the full war, scenarios are provided with the historical setups as of the start of 1862, 1863 and 1864.&#10;&#10;The Civil War isn't the biggest game ever produced on that dreadful conflict, but it is certainly among the most ambitious in its scope and degree of detail.&#10;&#10;";2;1200;12;2;1200;The Civil War;1200;1983;Ted Koller,The West Point Museum;American Civil War,Civil War,Post-Napoleonic,Wargame;Eric Lee Smith;;Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Simulation;Victory Games (I);7.67152;948;the civil war;6;0.0;0.0;3.772727272727273;0;0.0;AW5e6W4f47;False;0;2.0;1200.0;12.0;2.0;120.0;The Civil War;11;2;0;120-1200;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;84;1983.0;the civil war
151;1365;2165;"Pok&eacute;mon is one of several Collectible Card Games based upon Japanese anime that have found success internationally, and is one of the longest surviving CCGs currently available.  In fact, Pok&eacute;mon was one of the first Collectible Card Games to offer any competition to the market dominance of Magic:  The Gathering, even though most of the people who buy the product do not play the game, choosing instead to collect their favorite characters from the franchise the game is based upon.[citation needed]&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to play your Pok&eacute;mon cards, that represent different creatures, to battle against each other.  The first player to &quot;knock out&quot; (defeat) six opposing Pok&eacute;mon wins the game.  You play the game with a deck of sixty cards that represent your Pok&eacute;mon, as well as Trainer cards and Energy cards.  Trainer cards affect the game, players or Pok&eacute;mon in different ways, most of them temporary, while Energy cards act as the resources in the game.&#10;&#10;You start the game by drawing seven cards.  Each player picks a Basic Pok&eacute;mon from their hand and places it in front of them to start.  This is called the Active Pok&eacute;mon and is the one currently dueling.  Players can also place other Basic Pok&eacute;mon to fill up the five slots on their &quot;Bench&quot;.  Six cards are then set aside to act as Prizes.  Each time you defeat one of your opponent's Pok&eacute;mon, you get to draw one of these Prize cards.  Players take alternating turns during which they can:&#10;&#10;     put Pok&eacute;mon in play on their Bench&#10;     place an Energy card on one of their Pok&eacute;mon (once per turn)&#10;     play Trainer cards&#10;     evolve one of their Pok&eacute;mon&#10;     retreat - Have their Active Pok&eacute;mon trade places with one on the Bench (usually at the cost of Energy cards)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;In addition to Basic Pok&eacute;mon cards, there are also Evolution cards, which depict evolved forms of Basic Pok&eacute;mon (or sometimes other Evolved Pok&eacute;mon). A player can evolve a Pok&eacute;mon by laying a corresponding Evolution card onto another Pok&eacute;mon card in play.  This can only be done once per turn per Pok&eacute;mon, and only if the Pok&eacute;mon has been in play at least one entire turn.  The Evolved Pok&eacute;mon retains any damage and Energy cards, but loses any Special Conditions affecting it, and the card text completely replaces the previous card.&#10;&#10;The last action a player takes during their turn, if they choose, is to have their Active Pok&eacute;mon use one of its abilities to attack the other player's Active Pok&eacute;mon.  Attacks can only be used if the Pok&eacute;mon has enough Energy cards of the right type attached to it to meet the requirements for the attack; each attack has different requirements and effects that are listed on the card.  Most attacks will do some amount of damage to the Defending Pok&eacute;mon; if defeated, the Defending Pok&eacute;mon is replaced with another Pok&eacute;mon from the Bench, and the attacker draws a Prize card.  If either the attacker draws their last Prize card or the Defender cannot replace the Active Pok&eacute;mon (due to an empty Bench), the attacker has won the game.&#10;&#10;There are many different varieties of Pok&eacute;mon available and several different forms of each one, each with different attacks, abilities and characteristics, allowing for many different possible outcomes.

157;1518;2452;"A tower building game.&#10;&#10;Jenga is played with 54 wooden blocks; each block is 3 times as long as it is wide, and slightly smaller in height than in width. The blocks are stacked in a tower formation; each story is three blocks placed adjacent to each other along their long side, and each story is placed perpendicular to the previous (so, for example, if the blocks in the first story are pointing north-south, the second story blocks will point east-west). There are therefore 18 stories to the Jenga tower. Since stacking the blocks neatly can be tedious, a plastic loading tray is included.&#10;&#10;Once the tower is built, the person who built the tower moves first. Moving in Jenga consists of taking one and only one block from any story except the completed top story of the tower at the time of the turn, and placing it on the topmost story in order to complete it. Only one hand at a time may be used to remove a block; both hands can be used, but only one hand may be on the tower at a time. Blocks may be bumped to find a loose block that will not disturb the rest of the tower. Any block that is moved out of place may be left out of place if it is determined that it will knock the tower over if it is removed. The turn ends when the next person to move touches the tower, although he or she can wait 10 seconds before moving for the previous turn to end if they believe the tower will fall in that time.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the tower falls in any significant way -- in other words, any piece falls from the tower, other than the piece being knocked out to move to the top.

The only caveat to placing a piece is that it may not lie adjacent to your other pieces, but instead must be placed touching at least one corner of your pieces already on the board.&#10;&#10;There is a solitaire variation where one player tries to get rid of all the pieces in a single sitting.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;Blokus Game Board (400 squares)&#10;84 game pieces (four 21-piece sets of red, green, blue, and yellow)&#10;Each color inlcudes:&#10;&#10;     1 one-square piece&#10;     1 piece with 2 squares&#10;     2 pieces with 3 squares&#10;     5 pieces with 4 squares&#10;     12 pieces with 5 squares&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Goal of the Game:&#10;&#10;Each player has to fit as many of his/her 21 pieces on the board as possible.&#10;&#10;How to Play:&#10;1.  Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of his/her side of the board.  The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, and then green.&#10;&#10;2.  The first player (blue) places any of his/her pieces in a corner square.  Play proceeds clockwise around the board (yellow, red, and green), each player putting their first piece down in one of the corner squares.&#10;&#10;3.  Play continues as each player lays down one piece during a turn.&#10;&#10;Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but only at the corners.&#10;&#10;No flat edges of same color pieces can touch.&#10;&#10;There are no restrictions on how pieces of different colors can touch one another.&#10;&#10;4.  Whenever a player is unable to place one of his/her remaining pieces on the board, that player must pass his/her turn.&#10;&#10;End of Game:&#10;The game ends when all players are blocked from laying down any more of their pieces.  This also includes any players who may have placed all of their pieces on the board.  Scores are tallied, and the player with the highest score is the winner.&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;Each player counts the number of unit squares in his/her remaining pieces (1 unit square = -1 point).&#10;&#10;A player earns +15 points if all his/her pieces have been placed on the board plus 5 additional bonus points if the last piece placed on the board was the smallest piece (one square).&#10;&#10;There are unauthorized versions of the game published under various names, including The Strategy Game, Tetris, Blok&aacute;d (unofficial Hungarian version with cardboard pieces) and The Family Chess Game.&#10;&#10;";4;20;5;2;20;Blokus;20;2000;Alan D.

But they still haunt the house.  You must try to find out who was murdered, by what means and why.&#10;&#10;The cards include Motive cards, No Clue cards and a single &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; card.  In addition, there are cards that can be assembled side by side to form larger pictures: the six guests (Cleopatra, Napoleon, etc. --they were costumed, you see; in four pieces), four weapons (also in four pieces) and Alfred Hitchcock (in six pieces).  Seven cards are dealt to each player, the rest into the house's rooms.  You enter a room by exact count, except that a 7, 11 or doubles allows you to go directly to the spot of your choice.  When you reach a room, you pick up the top card there and discard either it or another card from your hand to the &quot;Lawn&quot; --off the board.  These cards are laid face down without overlapping each other but are shown to the other players as they're laid down.  Later, you may try to recover a Lawn card by showing a card from your hand of the appropriate type (a piece of a guest, for example) and then pointing to a Lawn card and picking it up.  If you remembered right, you may repeat the procedure.  You can also claim cards from other players by meeting them in the house and &quot;accusing them&quot; of withholding a particular card (this is what the No Clue cards are defence for).  Once the rooms are empty, everyone gathers in the hall and play is speeded up.&#10;&#10;First player to assemble a Ghost, Weapon and Motive OR Alfred and &quot;It's a Mystery to Me&quot; wins.&#10;&#10;";4;45;12;2;45;Why;45;1958;;Deduction,Memory,Movies / TV / Radio theme,Murder/Mystery;(Uncredited);Ghosts;Roll / Spin and Move,Set Collection,Trading;Alga,Chad Valley Co Ltd.,John Sands Pty Ltd,Juegos Crone,Jumbo,Milton Bradley,Otto Maier Verlag,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH;5.70069;73;why;60;0.0;0.0;0.0;0;0.0;7iuhqnuDiV;False;0;4.0;45.0;12.0;2.0;45.0;Why;0;2-4;2;45;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;87;1958.0;why

It removes the crayon aspect from network building in the original edition, while retaining the fluctuating commodities market like Crude: The Oil Game and an auction round intensity reminiscent of The Princes of Florence.&#10;&#10;The objective of Power Grid is to supply the most cities with power when someone's network gains a predetermined size.  In this new edition, players mark pre-existing routes between cities for connection, and then bid against each other to purchase the power plants that they use to power their cities.&#10;&#10;However, as plants are purchased, newer, more efficient plants become available, so by merely purchasing, you're potentially allowing others access to superior equipment.&#10;&#10;Additionally, players must acquire the raw materials (coal, oil, garbage, and uranium) needed to power said plants (except for the 'renewable' windfarm/ solar plants, which require no fuel), making it a constant struggle to upgrade your plants for maximum efficiency while still retaining enough wealth to quickly expand your network to get the cheapest routes.&#10;&#10;Power Grid FAQ - Please read this before posting a rules question!

173;1677;2799;"Arabian Nightmare: The Kuwait War, was designed and published while the late 1990 events in Kuwait were still unfolding, so in effect it was a near-future game which became an historical game within a few months.&#10;&#10;The game has one map and 300 counters. The map covers the Persian Gulf, Saudi Arabia, the eastern part of Iraq and its border with Iran. Turn/Time Scale is 1-3 days per Military Action Segment and 4-6 days per Political Action Segment (a full turn is 2 MAS and 1 PAS, so 6-12 days total).&#10;&#10;The game may be played using only the Military rules, the Political rules or both sets. There is an Introductory Game as well. There are 7 scenarios including the full campaign.&#10;&#10;This is a medium-high complexity game with many creative mechanisms and special rules.

174;1679;2802;"War in Europe is a compendium of three modules, War in the East 2nd ed., War in the West, and War in Europe. The two base games, War in the East 2nd ed. and War in the West, are both playable individually and are both designed for two sided play. War in Europe provides an integrated linkage between these two and provides for three player play.&#10;&#10;The game system traces its lineage from SPI's earlier Kursk and Destruction of Army Group Centre but was primarily inspired by War in the  East 1st. ed.  War in Europe is played on nine full sized (22&quot;x34&quot;) coloured  maps and employs about 3600 1/2x1/2&quot; cardboard pieces.&#10;&#10;The three sides in the full game are the Italo-German Axis, the Anglo- French-American Allies, and the Soviet Union. Political rules govern the  alignment of neutral states and restrict the use of active minor power units  by the controlling players. Rules also restrict the degree of co-operation between units of differing nationalities, whether Axis or Allied. The victory  conditions are also constructed to limit the degree of co-operation between  independent Allied and Soviet players.&#10;&#10;Each 3/4&quot; hex represents 20 miles. A single game-turn consists of three sequential player turns and represents one week elapsed time. Four game- turns form a 'cycle' at the beginning of which strategic warfare and economic production takes place. Thirteen cycles form a game year. Both Axis and Soviet power produce additional forces via a simplified economic  production process. Allied forces are received only by a preset reinforcement schedule.&#10;&#10;Player pieces called units represent division and brigade sized military formations. In addition to units, all powers also possess air-point counters representing abstract air power at an estimated scale of 500 sorties per point. Markers are a third category of playing piece used to note some temporary alteration to the map or to a unit.&#10;&#10;Allied and Axis powers have amphibious point counters representing invasion lift assets. Each amphibious point is capable of lifting a single divisional sized unit and as acting as a 'beachhead' supply source. The Axis powers also have counters for Naval Transport points and Naval Surface Combat points. The Axis may build these points via his production routines.&#10;&#10;Naval points (of all types) risk interception and elimination (along with any transported unit) by air power when used to transport land units, enable  supply, or provide escort. Axis naval points also risk Allied naval interception and elimination when conducting transport operations on the high seas (anywhere other than the Baltic). The Allied player has a  standard number of naval transport points (15) that does not change from turn to turn and which cannot be destroyed when intercepted, though their cargo may be. Expended (not destroyed) amphibious points are automatically returned to play after a nine turn delay.&#10;&#10;The Soviet power possesses one transport point in the Baltic so long as Leningrad remains uncaptured and one naval transport point in the Black Sea so long as the Soviet retains at least one Black Sea port. If the Soviets ever lose their naval transport capability in either sea then it is lost for the rest of the game and cannot be restored.&#10;&#10;The Axis power possesses counters for sub points and markers for land fortifications (the Atlantic Wall). Both of these must be produced using the economic system employed during the strategic inter-phase conducted at the start of each cycle. Sub points are used to determine the rate of Allied reinforcement and are themselves subject to loss.&#10;&#10;The Allied power receives Strategic Bomber Points which are used to disable Axis Production and Transportation during the Strategic Inter- phase. These are subject to loss by German Strategic Air Defence air- points and Flak Points.&#10;&#10;A number of scenarios are provided covering the entire war or significant campaigns. Victory is determined by the Axis political point total and the possession of specified hexes. The Axis political point total is adjusted during the game based on Allied and Axis actions together with the control of specific hexes or the conquest/occupation/liberation of nations. A novel feature in the design is the use of varying CRTs by nation/year to account for the changing relationships in the combat power of units over the course of a six year war without recourse to replacement counters for the units.&#10;&#10;The original game was issued in SPI notorious 'flat-pack' plastic tray packaging that required three units to contain the product. Later (1978?) War in Europe was retailed in the large bookcase box format (the Soap- box). The game was ported to a MS-DOS computer program published by  Decision Games in 1996 and a revised reprint of the original boardgame was published by Decision Games in 1999. A New PC version of war in Europe will allow players to battle one another PBEM or face to face and is currently under development.&#10;&#10;The game contains: &#10;- 3600 counters&#10;&#10;        (Three identical Axis 400 counter contersheets)&#10;        (Three identical Russian 400 counter contersheets)&#10;        (Three identical Western Allied 400 counter contersheets)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;- Nine maps (A-H,J)&#10;- Four Rulebooks&#10;&#10;        (Standard Rules)&#10;        (War in the East 2nd Edition Exclusive Rules)&#10;        (War in the West Exclusive Rules)&#10;        (War in Europe Exclusive Rules)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;- Axis Production Spiral&#10;- Soviet Production Spiral&#10;- Axis Game-Turn Cycle Record Track&#10;- Soviet Game-Turn Cycle Record Track &#10;- Allied Game-Turn Cycle Record Track&#10;- Two Identical War in the East Comvbat Results Tables&#10;- Two Identical War in the West Comvbat Results Tables&#10;&#10;";3;360;14;2;360;War in Europe;360;1976;Redmond A.

175;1681;2808;"On the 18th of December, 1940 Hitler issued Fuhrer Directive No. 21, code named Barbarossa, which stated: &ldquo;The Soviet Union is to be crushed in one swift campaign before the war with England ends.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;On the 22nd of June, 1941, Barbarossa was finally launched. Over three million German soldiers, most of them veterans of the campaigns in Poland, France, and the Balkans, began a blitzkrieg style of invasion against two million Russian defenders. The initial advance was fantastic. Hundreds of thousands of prisoners were taken and the motorized divisions began to outrun the rest of the army. The Germans reached the gates of Moscow, victor in sight. Then the winter came.&#10;&#10;RUSSIAN CAMPAIGN has been universally acclaimed as one of the finest wargames around. With the ease and playability of the 'Classics', the game also conveys the feel of the actual campaign and is exceptionally accurate historically. Both players will have to use the subtle skills, advantages, and tactics of their historical counterparts to win.&#10;&#10;Game features include rail movement, sea movement, invasions, stukas, partisans, automatic victory, SS units, sudden death victory conditions, and double impulse movement capabilities.

179;1704;2854;"Exploration was a very popular 1970s game from Britain's best game company, Waddingtons. The dramatic &amp; colourful box cover, showing the Kon Tiki raft, mountain climbers, ziggurats, and scuba divers on a wreck, inspired thousands of British kids to explore the globe, at least in their fantasies. To win, you must mount an exploration to one of four Objectives (Lost City, Summit, Island and Sunken Galleon), return to base and make the most money. Being first back was not enough, you've got to make the best profit on your trip.&#10;The game is played in 2 phases; initially you move round the outer track on die rolls, collecting Personnel cards, buying Equipment cards and drawing Exploration Club cards (which may gain or cost you cash to the Prize Fund). When your group is assembled, take the appropriate dobber (Yacht, Lorry, Tent or Ship) and set off.&#10;The 2nd phase has you moving over land or sea using the unique Diradice, a d6 with a 5 symbols. These allow you to move 1 or 2 spaces orthogonally or diagonally. The problem is that the spaces on the board are littered with symbols which you can only cross if you have the correct equipment, like the compass, dinghy or mountain boots. You must have an explorer with the Main Objective to reach your goal, but the other personnel allow you to avoid hazards and reach Lesser Objectives (Skeleton, Pearls, Rare Flower etc.) to gain cash. 1st, 2nd and 3rd home get cash and 1st back gets the Prize Fund.&#10;A pretty simple game of dice rolling, the only real choice is when to launch your trip.

183;1769;2987;"Come aboard and sail to Pirate's Cove, the legendary hideaway of thieving pirates and cutthroat buccaneers. The tales of those legendary pirates of old who've fought and survived these mysterious waters still haunt all those who yearn for a life at sea. Armed with a secret map and starting with a modestly outfitted sloop salvaged from last winter's storm, you set sail to Pirate's Cove, your eyes filled with visions of treasure and fame, your lungs filled with the salty air of the high seas.&#10;&#10;Your objective: to battle for the rights to plunder and become the most famed and feared pirate the world has ever seen. To do so, you will need to navigate shrewdly, fight recklessly and pillage mercilessly. You will gain fame by winning battles; burying gold and treasure; and bragging about your exploits at the tavern. At the end of twelve months, the pirate with the most fame will be declared the most fearsome pirate of the high seas!&#10;&#10;The game has 12 turns and at the start of every turn, each pirate must decide (secretly) which of the six islands they will visit. All players reveal their navigation directions simultaneously and then the turn is resolved. If any two or more pirates end up at the same island, Combat ensues.&#10;&#10;Combat resolution is determined by the strengths of your ship and the results of cannon fire (dice). The goal of combat is to scare away rival pirates so that you are the only pirate left at the island. If you stay in combat too long, your ship will suffer and make subsequent turns more difficult, so there is a fine balance of when to stay and fight and when to let the bigger ship have its booty. If you flee from combat, you end up at Pirate's Cove where you receive a small compensation for the turn. Once all conflicts are resolved, then the bounty for each island is given out.&#10;&#10;Each island (except Pirate's Cove and Treasure Island) offer various amounts of Fame, Gold, Treasure or Tavern cards. The bounty is skewed so that some Islands are clearly better choices than others, so it can force you to decide (or bluff) if you think you can take the island should other pirates go after the same bounty. Once you have your bounty, you can purchase upgrades for your ship. Each Island offers a different ship component. The four parts of your ship are: Sails (determines speed and initiative in combat), Hull (how much treasure you can carry), Crew (needed to man the cannons), and Cannons. (The lower number of Crew and Cannons determines how many dice you roll in combat).&#10;&#10;There is also an island with a Pub that offers useful strategy cards to help you in all aspects of the game. The last island is treasure island which offers no real bounty other than the chance to bury treasures that you have in the hull of your ship. Buried treasure is converted to Fame (which is the ultimate goal of the game).&#10;&#10;Other random elements of the game include the dreaded Legendary Pirates who are highly dangerous ships that patrol the islands in order. One of 5 different Legendary Pirates (which include famous names like Blackbeard and The Flying Dutchman) is drawn at the beginning of every game, and stays until defeated. If you end up at the same island as one of them, you had better have a strong ship and helpful allies or they will blast you with their powerful cannons. However, if you can manage to sink their ships, you can score a good amount of fame! But beware, once you defeat him/her a new Legendary Pirate will appear to wreck havoc in the islands.&#10;&#10;At the very end of the game, there is a chance for everyone to tell &quot;tall tales&quot; about themselves to increase their final fame standings. These tall tale cards are gained at the pub and offer yet another fun &quot;pirate&quot; mechanic. In all, Pirate's Cove offers you the chance to truly play like a pirate where you can fight and plunder your way to victory.&#10;&#10;";5;90;8;3;60;Pirate's Cove;90;2002;Cyrille Daujean,Julien Delval,Swen Papenbrock,Markus Wagner;Adventure,Fighting,Nautical,Pirates;Paul Randles,Daniel Stahl;;Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Pick-up and Deliver,Simultaneous Action Selection;AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH,Days of Wonder,Lautapelit.fi;6.59667;7167;pirate's cove;73;0.0;0.0;2.963235294117648;0;0.0;dhBQUVPDlD;False;0;5.0;90.0;8.0;3.0;60.0;Pirate's Cove;68;3-5;158;60-90;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;568;2002.0;pirate's cove

186;1814;3076;"In Puerto Rico players assume the roles of colonial governors on the island of Puerto Rico. The aim of the game is to amass victory points by shipping goods to Europe or by constructing buildings.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a separate small board with spaces for city buildings, plantations, and resources. Shared between the players are three ships, a trading house, and a supply of resources and doubloons.&#10;&#10;The resource cycle of the game is that players grow crops which they exchange for points or doubloons. Doubloons can then be used to buy buildings, which allow players to produce more crops or give them other abilities. Buildings and plantations do not work unless they are manned by colonists.&#10;&#10;During each round, players take turns selecting a role card from those on the table (such as &quot;Trader&quot; or &quot;Builder&quot;). When a role is chosen, every player gets to take the action appropriate to that role. The player that selected the role also receives a small privilege for doing so - for example, choosing the &quot;Builder&quot; role allows all players to construct a building, but the player who chose the role may do so at a discount on that turn. Unused roles gain a doubloon bonus at the end of each turn, so the next player who chooses that role gets to keep any doubloon bonus associated with it. This encourages players to make use of all the roles throughout a typical course of a game.&#10;&#10;Puerto Rico uses a variable phase order mechanic, where a &quot;governor&quot; token is passed clockwise to the next player at the conclusion of a turn. The player with the token begins the round by choosing a role and taking the first action.&#10;&#10;Players earn victory points for owning buildings, for shipping goods, and for manned &quot;large buildings.&quot; Each player's accumulated shipping chips are kept face down and come in denominations of one or five. This prevents other players from being able to determine the exact score of another player. Goods and doubloons are placed in clear view of other players and the totals of each can always be requested by a player. As the game enters its later stages, the unknown quantity of shipping tokens and its denominations require players to consider their options before choosing a role that can end the game.&#10;&#10;";5;150;12;2;90;Puerto Rico;150;2002;Harald Lieske,Franz Vohwinkel;City Building,Economic,Farming;Andreas Seyfarth;Alea Big Box,Colonial Theme,Country: Puerto Rico,Puerto Rico,Tableau Building;Variable Phase Order;alea,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH,Albi,Broadway Toys LTD,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Gém Klub Kft.,Giochi Uniti,Grow Jogos e Brinquedos,Kaissa Chess & Games,Lacerta,Lautapelit.fi,MINDOK,Rio Grande Games,Stratelibri,Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.,Tilsit;8.091569999999999;47789;puerto rico;6;3.0;4.0;3.7722843886462902;0;0.33;k7pnwdyDfC;False;13;5.0;150.0;12.0;2.0;90.0;Puerto Rico;458;2-5;2126;90-150;29.99;64.99;49.99;0.0;2514;2002.0;puerto rico
187;1819;3085;"Gang of Four&trade; is an exciting game of Cunning, Strategy and Power. The game's premise is simple - be the first to rid yourself of all your cards and ascend to supreme power. But beware - a strategic misstep may find you in a struggle to survive.&#10;&#10;History&#10;The term, Gang of Four, was first used to describe four powerful radicals in Communist China that rose to power during the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) and dominated Chinese politics during the early 1970s. Led by Jiang Qing, a former actress and the power-hungry wife of Chairman Mao, the Gang of Four dominated political, economic and cultural life in China for years. One month after Mao's death, they were arrested and jailed, thus ending China's slide into radicalism.&#10;&#10;The Gang of Four card game was first conceived during the upheaval of the Cultural Revolution. The game's inventor, Lee Yih, wanted to convey the mystery, intrigue and intense struggle for power that embodied not only China's recent political history - but also its past.&#10;Like the political Gang of Four, the game embodies a never-ending battle for supremacy - where the weak perish and the strong dominate. Good players, like good politicians, must show cunning, flexibility and ruthlessness.&#10;&#10;What's in the box?&#10;Gang of Four features a special 64-card deck, illustrated using a traditional Chinese theme, plus 2 rules summary cards to make learning and playing the game easier, a full-color rules booklet, scorepad and a Days of Wonder Web-Card, providing you with access to Gang of Four Online at www.gangoffour.com&#10;&#10;Gameplay&#10;All the cards are dealt to the players. The player who was dealt the multi-colored &quot;1&quot; card starts the hand and must use this card on the first play.  The players proceed taking turns clockwise and then counterclockwise on subsequent hands. On one's turn one must play the same number of cards but a higher ranked set than the previous player. A player may play  more cards if those cards are four or more of a kind. A round continues until all players pass because they can not or choose not to play cards. All cards played are discarded and the winner of the previous round leads. The hand continues until one player has used all the cards in his or her hand. The other players are penalized points on an escalating scale according to the number of cards in their hands. The game is over when one player has scored one hundred and the player with the lowest score wins.&#10;&#10;";4;40;8;3;40;Gang of Four;40;1990;Franck Achard,Cyrille Daujean;Card Game,Political;Lee Yih;Climbing Games,Country: China,Shedding Games;Hand Management,Set Collection,Trick-taking;Days of Wonder,Edge Entertainment,The Game Dealers Ltd.,Jeux Dargaud;6.59749;1882;gang of four;47;0.0;0.0;2.821428571428572;0;0.0;6OkILFnLYz;True;0;4.0;60.0;8.0;3.0;40.0;Gang of Four;28;3-4;38;40-60;0.0;0.0;0.0;5.57;281;1990.0;gang of four

The pieces in the game are cubes that have a circle on one side, a cross on another, and blank faces on the other four; to set up the game, players place the 25 cubes with blanks face-up on the 5x5 grid in the game board.&#10;&#10;On a turn, the active player takes a cube that is blank or bearing his symbol from the outer ring of the grid, rotates it so that it shows his symbol (if needed), then adds it to the grid by pushing it into one of the rows from which it was removed. Thus, a few pieces of the grid change places each turn, and the cubes slowly go from blank to crosses and circles. Play continues until someone forms an orthogonal or diagonal line of five cubes bearing his symbol, with this person winning the game.&#10;&#10;";4;15;6;2;15;Quixo;15;1995;;Abstract Strategy;Thierry Chapeau;5x5 grid,Combinatorial,Gigamic Basic,Gigamic Classic,Mensa Select,n in a row;Pattern Building,Tile Placement;Family Games, Inc.,Fundex,Gigamic,Oficina do Aprendiz;6.09373;551;quixo;10;0.0;0.0;2.555555555555556;0;0.29;Lx7PEv31ce;False;0;4.0;15.0;6.0;2.0;15.0;Quixo;9;2-4;12;15;24.99;23.42;19.95;0.0;143;1995.0;quixo

191;1886;3265;"NUTS! The Battle of the Bulge is a card game for 2-4 players recreating the famous WWII battle in which the German Army mounted a surprise attack on the thin U.S. forces deployed in the Ardennes region, hoping to break through to the English Channel and split the Allied Forces.  Each player controls either the German or the U.S. and British forces.  Players draw cards in each daily turn from their own decks, then play the cards as they see fit.  Many cards can be played during the opponent's turn so there is constant interaction.  Each deck is complete; there are no cards to collect or trade.  NUTS! comes in two 150-card sets (North and South).  Each set is complete and can be played on its own, or the two sets can be played together.  (From the back of the box by Decision Games)&#10;&#10;The cards have actual photographs of units, events, cities, and equipment from the battle.  Cards comprise of units (infantry, artillery, mechanized), events like bad weather or supply drops, and terrain to include cities, major forest, rivers, and ridges.  Units are rated in strength values for infantry, armor, artillery, and cohesion.  The objectives are for the Germans to get three panzer units (six if playing both decks) from their start side off the Allied side of the board.  The Allies must prevent this and stall the offensive until adequate reinforcement arrival.  Although this is a card game, it plays very much like a board game.  Battles are resolved via dice rolling.  The rules do include important factors such as supply, town encirclement, weather, blitzes, cohesion checks, and the like.  Overall, an easy to medium game to grasp the rules and play.

195;2006;3570;"Theme: Chickens are learning to dance (&quot;cha cha&quot;) by completing circuits around the yard.&#10;&#10;Goal: To &quot;cha cha&quot; your chicken past every single other player's chicken, stealing each one's &quot;tail feathers&quot; as you go by them. The first player to collect all of the tail feathers wins.&#10;&#10;Setup: There are two sets of large, thick cardboard tiles.  One set of 12 are shaped as octagons, and the other set of 24 are shaped as eggs. Each octagon shows a different chicken-related image, and the same image appears on two of the eggs. The octagons are spread out randomly on the table, face down. The eggs are then arranged randomly, but face up, in a large circle around the octagons, creating a kind of &quot;pathway&quot; of egg tiles that is encircling the &quot;yard&quot; (of octagons). Each player has a single large wooden chicken in their color, and each chicken has slots on its backside into which wooden &quot;tail feathers&quot; may be stuck. Each chicken begins with only one tail feather, in its color. The chickens are then placed randomly on the egg tiles, with an equal number of unoccupied tiles separating each chicken from the next chicken &quot;ahead&quot; of it on the pathway as separate it from the next chicken &quot;behind&quot; it, with the goal that they be well spread out on the pathway.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is then played in turns, with players attempting to move their chickens clockwise around the pathway. On a player's turn, she looks at the image on the next egg tile in front of her chicken. The player then turns over one of the 12 face down octagon yard tiles. If the tile turned over shows the same image as the egg tile, the player moves forward one space on to that egg tile, turns the octagon back face down, and then repeats the process with the next egg tile. When the player turns over an octagon with an image that does not match the next egg tile in front of her, her turn ends and her chicken goes no farther. If the next tile in front of a player is occupied by someone else's chicken, then the player looks at the image that is on the egg tile in front of the other chicken, and then attempts to turn over the octagon showing *that* image. If the player succeeds, her chicken &quot;leapfrogs&quot; over the chicken in front of her to land on that egg tile, and in the process steals all tail feathers that the other chicken had - including those it stole from other players in the same manner. When one player has all of the tail feathers, that player wins the game.&#10;&#10;In Sum: A creative memory game that ties memory to pawn movement.  The first player to successfully memorize the images on each of the 12 octagon tiles, both from their own turns and from watching other players flip the octagons on their turns, will be able to move their chicken around the yard without stopping, and in doing so will win the game. The placement of the octagons is random, so the challenge is fresh each game.&#10;&#10;This game is part of The Chicken Family of Zoch&#10;&#10;The Zicke Zacke Igelkacke version has the same rules but hedgehogs instead of chicken, and it's in a smaller box.&#10;The Hasbro version has the same rules, but is a Dragon Tales re-theme with large cardboard dragons as player pieces.&#10;&#10;";4;20;4;2;20;Chicken Cha Cha Cha;20;1997;Doris Matthäus;Animals,Children's Game,Memory;Klaus Zoch;Animals: Chickens,Animals: Dragons,Animals: Hedgehogs/Porcupines,The Chicken Family of Zoch;Memory;999 Games,Aires, Fanha e Raposo, Lda,Devir,Egmont Polska,FoxMind Israel,Gigamic,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,Laser plus,Milton Bradley,Piatnik,Rio Grande Games,Stupor Mundi,Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.,Tactic,ZickZack Spieleverlag,Zoch Verlag;6.62478;2165;chicken cha cha cha;76;0.0;0.0;3.351851851851852;0;0.0;bycI7d4iqe;False;0;4.0;20.0;4.0;2.0;15.0;Chicken Cha Cha Cha;27;2-4;105;15-20;0.0;0.0;57.95;0.0;289;1997.0;chicken cha cha cha
196;2040;3632;"This Reiner Knizia concoction is a sort of a trick-taking game, but instead of everybody playing one card and seeing which one wins the trick, everybody takes turns adding cards until the total adds up to 10 or more and the player who added that card takes the whole pile.&#10;&#10;This can be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on the player's goal for that particular round!  There are five rounds in the game and exactly five different goals to be fulfilled:  to take as many mushroom cards as you can, or as many pea soup cards, or as many onion cards, or as many chili pepper cards, or to take no cards at all.  (The pepper cards, incidentally, count minus 1 unless your goal for the round is to collect them.)  Goals are revealed simultaneously, so you may or may not be in competition with another player for the same cards during the round.  And you can't choose a goal you've already chosen, so things can get pretty tough especially on the last hand, where no matter what cards you're dealt, you *have* to go for whichever of the five goals you haven't done already.&#10;&#10;Since the game is always exactly five rounds, it lasts a good dependable half an hour every time.&#10;&#10;";5;30;10;2;30;Too Many Cooks;30;2002;Scott Fleenor,Rob McClurkan,Alexandre Roche;Card Game;Reiner Knizia;Food / Cooking;Hand Management,Set Collection,Trick-taking,Voting;Kanga Games,Pegasus Spiele,R&R Games,University Games;6.34243;971;too many cooks;47;0.0;0.0;3.0;0;0.0;Hy9ZbFMIhH;False;0;5.0;30.0;10.0;2.0;30.0;Too Many Cooks;10;2-5;27;30;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;141;2002.0;too many cooks

In doing so, you must keep your bunnies alive as long as possible, while eliminating your opponents' Bunnies because once all the Carrots have been claimed you must have a living Bunny to win.&#10;&#10;The problem: Your opponents are armed with outrageous weapons (from level 1 weapons such as a &quot;Kitchen Whisk&quot; to level 12 weapons such as the &quot;Nuclear Warhead&quot;) and you must roll higher than these levels to survive.&#10;&#10;Use cards to defend your Bunnies, such as the hilarious &quot;Magic Spatula&quot; or other special cards, or use a &quot;Feed The Bunny&quot; card to force your opponent to buy cabbage and water (if they have the money to do so...)&#10;&#10;Your opponents, as the back of the box quotes, &quot;will stop at nothing to keep you from winning the game, which can get dreadfully vengeful, horribly nasty, hilariously messy, and just plain fun!&quot;&#10;&#10;The game includes 165 cards (including the Blue Starter Deck and Yellow Booster Deck), 36 small cards, 6 twelve-sided dice, &amp; Instructions.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;     Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot RED Booster&#10;     Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot VIOLET Booster&#10;     Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot ORANGE Booster&#10;     Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot GREEN Booster&#10;     Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot Twilight WHITE Booster&#10;     Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot Stainless STEEL Booster&#10;     Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot Perfectly PINK Booster&#10;     Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot Wacky KHAKI Booster&#10;     Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot: Ominous Onyx Booster&#10;     Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot: Chocolate Booster&#10;     Killer Bunnies Bunny Blanks #1&#10;     Killer Bunnies Bunny Blanks #2&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";8;90;12;2;90;Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot;90;2002;Jonathan Young;Animals,Card Game,Humor,Negotiation;Jeffrey Neil Bellinger;Animals: Rabbits,Killer Bunnies;Action / Movement Programming,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Set Collection,Take That,Trading;Edge Entertainment,Kikigagne?,Pegasus Spiele,Playroom Entertainment,Stratelibri;5.5065800000000005;4721;killer bunnies and the quest for the magic carrot;66;3.0;2.0;2.3935546875;0;0.4;aJA4SkCf97;False;0;8.0;45.0;12.0;2.0;45.0;Killer Bunnies and the Quest for the Magic Carrot;64;2-8;122;45;17.95;0.0;22.99;14.95;230;2002.0;killer bunnies and the quest for the magic carrot

In the course of the game you acquire cards which dictate that you must remove a certain piece from the body of the patient.

201;2129;3883;"This super-obscure game by Task Force Games is secretly based on the SF-novel &quot;The Iron Dream&quot; by the Jewish author Norman Spinrad. This very controversial novel describes a parallel world in which Hitler wasn't successful with his &quot;Kampf&quot; in Germany and became a successful SF-pulp-novelist in the US. The main part of the book is the actual text of Hitler's &quot;Iron Dream&quot;, a pulp-tale about &quot;Ubermenschen&quot; conquering a future world filled with mutant &quot;scum&quot;. The idea of Spinrad's novel was to expose fascist tendencies in 50's American literature. The TFG designers transported this &quot;theme&quot; into a board game which plays like a wargame: future Nazis against future mutants. The names of all protagonists have been changed to avoid copyright infringement, but the game clearly takes its slightly tongue-in-cheek approach directly from the book. One asks why this bittersweet parody has actually to be played as a game, but everybody can decide for him/herself I guess...&#10;&#10;";2;120;12;1;120;4th Reich;120;1985;Dana Lombardy,Bruce Weigle;Economic,Novel-based,Science Fiction,Wargame,World War II;Howard Anderson,Dana Lombardy;;Hex-and-Counter,Secret Unit Deployment;Task Force Games;4.67925;53;4th reich;9;0.0;0.0;0.0;0;0.0;N2PPbxjAQz;False;0;2.0;120.0;12.0;1.0;120.0;4th Reich;0;1-2;0;120;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;73;1985.0;4th reich

Character cards are placed face up on table, and also track strength (hand limit) in addition to special ability.&#10;&#10;There are 22 different types of cards in the draw deck. Most common are the BANG! cards, which let you shoot at another player, assuming the target is within &quot;range&quot; of your current gun.  The target player can play a &quot;MISSED!&quot; card to dodge the shot.  Other cards can provide temporary boosts while in play (for example, different guns to improve your firing range) and special one-time effects to help you or hinder your opponents (such as Beer to restore health, or Barrels to hide behind during a shootout). A horse is useful for keeping your distance from unruly neighbors, while the Winchester can hit a target at range 5. The Gatling is a deadly exception where range doesn't matter: it can only be used once, but targets all other players at the table!&#10;&#10;Information on the cards is displayed using language-independent symbols, and 7 summary/reference cards are included.&#10;&#10;";7;40;8;4;20;BANG!;40;2002;Alessandro Pierangelini;American West,Bluffing,Card Game,Deduction,Fighting;Emiliano Sciarra;BANG!;Hand Management,Partnerships,Player Elimination,Take That,Variable Player Powers;dV Giochi,ABACUSSPIELE,Albi,Asmodee,Bard Centrum Gier,Crómola,Edge Entertainment,Gém Klub Kft.,Grow Jogos e Brinquedos,Hobby World,Kaissa Chess & Games,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,Lautapelit.fi,Ludicus,Mayfair Games,NeoTroy Games,PS-Games,Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.,Tilsit;6.5575199999999985;19678;bang!;6;2.0;2.0;2.877742116415305;0;0.35;AaRXSVtjLn;False;0;7.0;40.0;10.0;4.0;20.0;BANG!;226;4-7;743;20-40;14.99;31.99;12.95;0.0;967;2002.0;bang!

Each player starts at level 1 and the winner is the first player to reach level 10. Players can acquire familiar D&amp;D style character classes during the game which determine to some extent the cards they can play.&#10;&#10;There are two types of cards - treasure and encounters. Each turn the current players 'kicks down the door' - drawing an encounter card from the deck. Usually this will involve battling a monster. Monsters have their own levels and players must try and overcome it using the levels, weapons and powers they have acquired during the game or run away. Other players can chose to help the player or hinder by adding extra monsters to the encounter. Defeating a monster will usually result in drawing treasure cards and acquiring levels. Being defeated by a monster results in &quot;bad stuff&quot; which usually involves losing levels and treasure.&#10;&#10;Note: The 2012 edition of Star Munchkin from Pegasus Spiele includes the first expansion, Star Munchkin 2: The Clown Wars.&#10;&#10;";6;90;10;3;90;Star Munchkin;90;2002;Wayne Barrett,John Kovalic,Len Peralta,Philip Reed,Gabby Ruenes;Card Game,Fighting,Humor,Science Fiction;Steve Jackson (I);Munchkin;Card Drafting,Dice Rolling,Take That,Trading,Variable Player Powers;Black Monk,Edge Entertainment,Hobby World,Monkey Time,Pegasus Spiele,Raven Distribution,Steve Jackson Games,Ubik;6.15139;3692;star munchkin;39;0.0;0.0;2.5348837209302317;0;-0.14;Z4kKbbiKK2;False;0;6.0;90.0;10.0;3.0;90.0;Star Munchkin;43;3-6;33;90;24.57;30.57;20.99;0.0;178;2002.0;star munchkin

The inhabitants of Keyland will gather the resources with which to build the Keythedral from the surrounding fields.&#10;&#10;The Keythedral will be built in five stages, and each stage will require different building materials. In the early stages, simple materials will be needed, and as the building nears completion, more specialized materials will be needed. Throughout the development period, the builders will require food and water, and, if they are lucky, the builders will also receive some wine.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with five cottages. Each cottage houses a worker. Each turn, every worker will try to move into one of the fields adjacent to their cottage in order to gather resources from the land. These resources are required for building the Keythedral.&#10;&#10;Problems, however, are at hand. Firstly, no one is ever quite sure what the building requirements for the next stage of the Keythedral will be until the previous stage is completed. Secondly, once more workers arrive, the fields will become crowded, and some of the workers will be idle. Players may choose to fence off some of the fields in order to keep out their opponents' workers. However, the workers are quite partial to the odd tipple, and for a couple of barrels of wine, they can be persuaded to remove any one of the fences that a player has taken offense to!&#10;&#10;Good luck in your endeavors to keep your workers productive and to get the right building materials at the right time.&#10;&#10;Keythedral is Richard Breese's fourth game in the key series.&#10;&#10;";5;90;8;2;60;Keythedral;90;2002;Juliet Breese;City Building,Medieval;Richard Breese;Key-series;Auction/Bidding,Modular Board,Set Collection,Tile Placement,Worker Placement;Cafe Games,Pro Ludo,PS-Games,R&D Games;7.10195;2794;keythedral;10;0.0;0.0;3.5400000000000005;0;0.0;YcVZzQNdgX;True;0;5.0;90.0;8.0;2.0;60.0;Keythedral;25;2-5;58;60-90;55.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;207;2002.0;keythedral
208;2221;4127;"The concept of Arne is new. Arne is cheeky, creative, and chaotic. And always spiced with the most unexpected turns. As a player, you change the direction of the game, take over someone&rsquo;s turn, protect your own cards, steal someone else&rsquo;s and wreck the strategy of your opponents. Your luck can turn at any moment: Arne literally goes every which way.&#10;&#10;Arne is suitable for all ages. A few practice games, and children from the age of seven start playing seriously. Boys and girls mainly enjoy the high tease factor of the game. But the countless combination possibilities make the game just as much fun for adults. You don&rsquo;t have to know Arne inside out to score well: luck plays an important part. Parents, children, grandparents &hellip; everybody&rsquo;s chances for winning are the same.&#10;&#10;There are no words printed on the Arne cards. So the game is universal: people of various mother tongues can play together perfectly well. Another great advantage is that the game does not take long to play: a round of Arne takes ten minutes, a quarter of an hour at the most. However, you will not know who is winning until the last cards have been played. Those who have saved plenty of points can be sent back to the beginning by just one card. And those who were not doing well can snatch victory at the very last minute.&#10;&#10;How ARNE Works!&#10;&#10;Whoever collects most points wins. Each player first chooses a color and then goes and tries to collect as many points of that color as possible. The other players try to do the same. The point of the game is to sabotage their attempts as much as possible. You do this by making use of the teaser cards. In order to make the game even more fun, there are two sorts of cards:&#10;&#10;White cards which you may only play when it is your turn &#10;Black cards which you may play whenever you want to&#10;&#10;In practice, all players can play cards at the same time.

It covers the Peninsula campaign.&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the back of the box:)&#10;&#10;On to Richmond! is an exciting game of strate&shy;gy and maneuver. McClellan has overwhelming force at first, but Richmond is a long way off and the rainy season has just begun. Meanwhile reinforcements from all over the south are arriving in Richmond under the command of General Joseph Johnston. Waiting in the wings is a Confederate general by the name of Robert E. Lee. &#10;On to Richmond! recreates one of the most significant campaigns of the Civil War.

The first to return wins Odin's favor, but any cunning corvid has a few tricks in store and these are the two most brilliant birds in Middle Earth.&#10;&#10;In the two-player card game Odin's Ravens, two ravens race across separate tracks, the tracks being comprised of domino-style landscape cards that feature different types of land. Each player has their own deck of cards, which they use to match the land type in front of their raven in order to advance the raven toward the end of the flight path. Odin (Loki in Osprey Edition) cards allow a player to take special actions, such as rearranging the track of landscape cards or impeding the other player's raven.&#10;&#10;In the first edition of Odin's Ravens, each player can create a personal auxiliary stack during play, playing cards from the hand now to set up plays in the future. The game lasts multiple rounds, with a round ending when a raven reaches the end of the flight path; that raven's player scores points equal to the distance separating the two ravens. There is also an Odin token that can slow down whichever raven it is in front of.  In addition, whoever has played more cards to the &quot;Magic Way&quot; during the round &ndash; a separate playing area in which players may play a particular type of card &ndash; wins three points. Once a player has accumulated twelve or more points, that player wins.&#10;&#10;The second edition of Odin's Ravens transforms the game into a single race across a longer landscape, with players drawing a limited number of cards each turn from either the Odin deck or the land deck and playing as many cards as they desire.

215;2366;4454;"More of a simulation than a balanced game, Statis Pro   Football uses the AH Fast Action Card system. Individual players are rated for their ability to throw/catch/run, block, rush the passer, and several other ratings. You are the coach for your team, and choose from a selection of offensive or defensive moves (Inside Run, Short Pass or Blitz, Run No Key as examples) which affect the outcome, and then flip a deck of cards to work out the result. So if I call the right pass defense against your pass, it becomes harder to complete the pass, or a Run defense means your Run gets less yardage. But if I get it wrong, my defense may have no effect or even greatly increase your chances.&#10;&#10;The game rules cover pretty much every eventuality, but with all the modifiers, it can slow down when combinations happen. In particular turnovers or penalties can make it slow. And luck can be a factor. Get it all right and you still lose the ball, or concede the TD.&#10;&#10;The basic game comes with stats cards for every player in every team. Avalon Hill produced several years worth of cards for use with the game, which you could buy separately. And a strong team will overwhelm a weaker team. Strong offense generally pushes past a weak D and there's not a lot you can do except be lucky. But by picking evenly-matched teams, it does require some forethought to work your team to a score. It's best to include the endurance rules, which mean that some players must 'rest' before you can re-direct a play to them. This means cycling players and dealing with injuries makes tricky decisions for you.&#10;&#10;If you love American Football and know the players and enjoy stats, then Statis Pro Football is for you.&#10;&#10;";2;120;12;1;120;Statis Pro Football;120;1973;;Sports;Jim Barnes;Sports: American Football / Gridiron;;Avalon Hill,Midwest Research;6.4168699999999985;335;statis pro football;57;0.0;0.0;3.333333333333333;0;0.0;EUy786pVvE;False;0;2.0;120.0;12.0;1.0;120.0;Statis Pro Football;3;1-2;53;120;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;76;1973.0;statis pro football

217;2413;4636;"The game is set in late prehistory, a time of transition &ndash; when our distant ancestors, who had struggled and barely survived for ages in very small nomadic groups, began to feel that their lives would be more secure and less arduous if they formed larger groups.  This led to the formation of the first villages.&#10;&#10;In Clans each player is trying to achieve victory by scoring as many points for their color as they can. This is tricky as each player's color is chosen at random and kept hidden until the end of the game. Each region of the board contains five areas, each one of five different types. Each area receives one hut each of five different colors. On their turn, a player moves all huts from one area containing less than seven to an adjacent area, all the while trying to hide which color is theirs. After moving , if one or more areas are completely surrounded by empty ones, they are scored. If all colors are present in a scoring, any colors with only one hut present are removed. The epoch track allows a limited number of areas to score before the game ends and each scoring will either gain a bonus or score nothing depending on the terrain type it occured in and how far along the track the game has progressed; each scoring advances the track, and each section of the track gives different terrain types bonuses and penalties.&#10;&#10;Once at least twelve areas have scored the game ends, players reveal their colors, and find out who was best able to score the most points while keeping their color a secret.&#10;&#10;";4;30;10;2;30;Clans;30;2002;Grafik Studio Krüger;Abstract Strategy,Bluffing,Deduction,Prehistoric;Leo Colovini;;Area Control / Area Influence,Area Enclosure;Rio Grande Games,Venice Connection,Winning Moves France,Winning Moves Germany;6.56588;4366;clans;45;0.0;0.0;2.9615384615384617;0;0.0;aP1yoyLmDE;False;0;4.0;120.0;12.0;1.0;30.0;Clans;39;1-4;181;30-120;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;219;2002.0;clans
218;2415;4642;"Tabletop baseball simulation game.&#10;&#10;In 1971, Time Inc (owner of Sports Illustrated magazine) published their first baseball game, titled Sports Illustrated Major League Baseball.  It included 20 players on each at-that-time current (1970 season) baseball team, presented on tri-fold color charts.  The following two years, they released new editions to cover the most recent season.  For 1972, they switched to teams of 25 players each, on double-sided color charts without folds.  In 1973, The game title was changed to Pennant Race and the team roster size was reduced to 19 or 20 players per team. The team charts were replaced by individual player cards on perforated sheets, with no color coding.&#10;&#10;Also in 1972, Time released a set of 16 All-Time All-Star Team Charts (in the same style as that year's edition), for each of the original American League and National League franchises, each with the 25 &quot;best&quot; players from that team's long history. In 1973, the same All-Time charts were released in a separate All-Time All-Star Baseball game.  This product was popular among tabletop managers.&#10;&#10;The All-Time All-Star game was then changed to an individual card format and retitled as Superstar Baseball.  This was later transferred to Avalon Hill when they picked up the entire line of sports games from Time.  This also granted Avalon Hill the right to use the words &quot;A Sports Illustrated Game&quot; on any Avalon Hill sports product, even if it wasn't part of the original Time, Inc line of games, which led to some confusion for titles such as Baseball Strategy, Football Strategy, and Pro Golf.&#10;&#10;Special dice with results ranging from 10 through 39 (often called 10-39 Dice, see How to make a set of SIBB dice -- A Tutorial) were required to play this game, and sister games in the original Sports Illustrated sports simulation line.&#10;&#10;";2;45;12;1;45;Sports Illustrated Baseball;45;1972;;Dice,Sports;David S.

A row can have at most three cards, so at some point everyone is forced to take a row. Once all the rows have been claimed, players start a new round, drawing or taking once again.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these cards? Collect huge sets - but only in three colors as every color beyond the third will cost you points. Jokers are highly-prized as they always match what you want, and +2 cards provide sure points, giving you a back-up plan if everything goes south in terms of the colors you're collecting.&#10;&#10;Once only a few cards remain in the deck, the round ends and everyone tallies their score, choosing three colors of cards to score positively while any other colors count against you.

244;2993;6810;"This game features a flat, 2-D board with a plastic, 3D inner ring and catwalk that are raised off of the regular board.  The rebels and R2 units look like the Rebel Commandos from the Endor assault and R2-D2 from Return of the Jedi.  The stormtrooper is a larger plastic mini, and used during the game when you roll a 1 (a stormtrooper helmet on the die).  The game is played in real-time, and the typical game lasts about 45-60 minutes.  The video tape is 60 minutes long.  Darth Vader does speak to you from time to time on the video tape (yes, you'll have to have a VCR for this game), and it's fairly cool to watch the video just by itself.  The video also has some elements of gameplay in them, as well as original music, video clips and the ending sequence of the destruction of the planet (in case you fail) is of the original Death Star blowing up Alderaan (from Ep4).&#10;&#10;When setting up, you choose a color for your rebel and R2 unit.  Then, you put your R2 unit in the droid control center and the rebel in the hanger bay.  Then place the stormtrooper in the Stormtrooper control center.  You then take 6 explosives and place them near you.  You also shuffle and deal out the Rebel Mission Card.  This tells you the rooms you need to plant explosives in and the key cards you need to obtain to enter the inner level.  You then start the VHS tape.  Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones) will come on and goad you.  You then begin play.  As stated above, play is in real-time, so you have to play quickly.  The objective is to plant your explosives and disable the Death Star II (turn off the VHS tape) before it reaches D'rinba IV.  The video is 60 minutes long, with movie scenes from the original trilogy and good music.  If you get caught by the stormtrooper, you get put into the detention block, and either have to have a card that gets you out or wait for the video to play &quot;detention block escape.&quot;  After 30 minutes or so, the player with the most amount of dark side points becomes Vader's &quot;pupil.&quot;  The Pupil is just like the stormtrooper, only you get to search rooms, attack your fellow rebels and foil their plans.  If there is a tie, then the youngest player gets to be the pupil.  It's a fast-paced fun board game that is sorely lacking these days.  This should be re-released with the movie on DVD.&#10;&#10;";6;60;8;3;60;Star Wars: The Interactive Video Board Game;60;1996;;Movies / TV / Radio theme,Science Fiction;(Uncredited);3D Games,Star Wars,VCR Board Games;;Parker Brothers;5.71447;141;star wars: the interactive video board game;5;0.0;0.0;2.6875;0;0.29;elUgUG3nWC;False;0;6.0;60.0;8.0;3.0;60.0;Star Wars: The Interactive Video Board Game;4;3-6;6;60;49.98;0.0;0.0;0.0;62;1996.0;star wars: the interactive video board game

Cards come in three levels of difficulty, with the easy cards being worth 1 point, medium cards worth 2 points, and hard cards worth 3 points.

On the back of the Flippos with numbers 291 t/m 305 this game could be found, after which it became very popular in those countries. This made the sellings of the 24 Game rise.

249;3122;7457;"The Maple Leaf Edition. The ultimate Canadian edition of Monopoly. While gameplay is the same as in 'classic' monopoly, this edition features numerous unique changes, including:&#10;- The box is the Canadian flag motif. &#10;- All properties are Canadian replacing the equivalent 'standard Monopoly' properties (a booklet is included describing the actual streets, railroads and utilities used on the board).&#10;- The insert is formed plastic to hold the money (standard) and slots for the properties to be displayed upright and two troughs for the houses and hotels. &#10;- An embossed gold maple leaf enhances the center of the board. &#10;- The Chance, Community Chest and Properties are non-standard sized and bi-lingual.&#10;- The board replaces the cop with a RCMP Mountie on the Go To Jail (Allez au Houscou) corner. &#10;- all railway spaces show the front of a Canadian train rather than the black Parker locomotive&#10;- The 10 metal playing pieces include 9 original to 'classic' version, and a new beaver token (of course!).&#10;&#10;For the 2000 2nd edition, all the pewter playing tokens were replaced with 8 true Canadian versions, including: Moose, Ski Plane, Bear, Hockey Player, Winter Boot, Sled, Canoe and Train. Other changes:&#10;- The banknotes design is different: In the centre is a maple leave and to it's left and right is a space showing the name of the sponsor Royal Bank.&#10;-Community chest and chance are replaced with bilingual 'Provincial' cards (red) and 'Federal' cards (yellow), both showing the same skyline picture as the box lid. They all show funny drawings with Mr. Monopoly (as Rich Uncle Pennybags will be called from 2000 onwards). &#10;The text on some of these cards have been adapted to uniquely Canadian situations.&#10;&#10;For the 2010 'Electronic Banking' edition of the game, an online contest was conducted in which participants were asked to vote for cities to be on the new board.

250;3160;7614;"Welcome to A World at War, an immersive gaming experience that explores the grand strategies of the Second World War. With roots tracing back to Avalon Hill's classic Rise and Decline of the Third Reich, and to its eventual successors--Advanced Third Reich and Empire of the Rising Sun--A World at War takes the system even further, expanding on the detail and choices in what was already a fine family of wargames.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         &#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         &#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         &#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         &#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         &#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1974,  1976,&#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         1992&#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         1995&#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         2003, 2013&#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         2015&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1981, 1984&#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;         &#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;A World at War, a game that brings you everything in one meaty box: elite marines and paratroopers battling infantry and armor; submarines and carriers ambushing cruisers and battlewagons; army planes and carrier planes crisscrossing the skies with bombers and interceptors and ultra-fast jets. Yet unlike in other games, in A World at War you decide which units to build the most of, and you decide where to deploy them. Will this corps go to Europe, or sail to the Pacific? Will these planes hunt the eastern front, or strafe the waters of the Med? Whichever you decide, decide carefully--for in A World at War, the employment of armaments is crucial. But don't be na&iuml;ve and think they constitute the only battlefield. The struggle also extends into foreign parliaments, through diplomacy; into your own skunk works, through research; and even behind enemy lines, through partisans. So seize every advantage you can get--not only in drop tanks and detonators, but also in oil fields and parkas. And most of all, stay flexible. For when the worst happens and you find yourself outwitted and outgunned, you may need to adjust your strategy. Is there time to surge-research the atomic bomb, or do you take the exigency--less glitzy but less risky--of barricading your beaches and erecting flak near your factories? (Self-recriminations can come later, like how you cracked too few encryptions, or gobbled too many islands, or skimped too much on Murmansk.) For all of these things are possible, all of these and more!&#10;&#10;&#10;A World at War, a game of warfare not only on land, under sea, and in the air--but also on trucks and in treasuries, on the lab bench and in the diplomatic pouch. With so many elements in play, winning strategies will always be interwoven and winning decisions always anguished. But if you hang on long enough, and if you unleash the latest weapons in the boldest assaults, well then you'll earn that rare chance to crush armies and rule empires . . . even if they're only cardboard.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Contents of the Second Edition:&#10;&#10;     2800 full-color single-sided die-cut counters, in ten countersheets.&#10;     Four 22-inch x 30-inch full-color mapsheets, forming two large maps of the European and Pacific theaters.&#10;     A 236-page rulebook.&#10;     A 104-page status-sheet booklet.&#10;     A 24-page research &amp; diplomacy booklet.&#10;     A 20-page scenario booklet.&#10;     Fifteen player aid cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Number&#10;&#10;         Color&#10;&#10;         Tables&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         olive&#10;&#10;         combat--attrition, CRT, air defense and combat, naval attack, nationality DRMs&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         lt blue&#10;&#10;         naval--interception, search, surprise, construction, raider, sub attack, air range&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         blue&#10;&#10;         strategic warfare--modifiers and combat, Pearl Harbor surprise, harbor attack&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         green&#10;&#10;         misc--winter, BRP costs, Commonwealth and minor country forces, naval activities&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         yellow&#10;&#10;         surrender--resistance modifiers, British concessions, U.S. elections&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         white&#10;&#10;         SoP, research results summary&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         1&#10;&#10;         white&#10;&#10;         historical charts--events, shipbuilding&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         4&#10;&#10;         many&#10;&#10;         naval status charts--TF displays&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         2&#10;&#10;         white&#10;&#10;         naval combat charts--CG tracking&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         2&#10;&#10;         white&#10;&#10;         conference&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Eight six-sided dice.&#10;     One deck of oil effect cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Air&#10;&#10;         Naval&#10;&#10;         Army&#10;&#10;         Economy&#10;&#10;         Construction&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         4&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;         4&#10;&#10;         3&#10;&#10;         3 &#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Four decks of Magic and Ultra cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;         Nation &#10;&#10;         Submarine&#10;&#10;         ASW&#10;&#10;         Tactical&#10;&#10;         Strategic&#10;&#10;         Combined&#10;&#10;         Blank&#10;&#10;         Wild&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         German&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         5&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         British&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         5&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         Japanese&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         6&#10;&#10;         0&#10;&#10;    &#10;    &#10;         American&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         2&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;         3&#10;&#10;         1&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     One GMT counter tray.&#10;     One pack of ziplocking bags.&#10;     One promo sheet.&#10;     One box.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#10;";8;2880;14;1;1440;A World at War;2880;2003;Rodger B.

When markers are jumped over by a ring they must be flipped, so their color is constantly changing. The players must try to form a row of five markers with their own color face up. If a player succeeds in doing so, he removes one of his rings as an indication that he has formed such a row. The first player to remove three of his rings wins the game.

259;3282;8125;"Santiago is about cultivating and watering fields. To accomplish this, a number of tiles denoting various plantation types come into the game each round. The tiles are auctioned off such that each player gets one, and the tiles are then placed onto the game board along with an ownership marker that also indicates how plentiful the tile's yield will be. Whoever bid the lowest in each round gets to be the canal overseer and decides where a canal will be built that round. The other players may make suggestions to help the canal overseer decide, and back up their suggestions with money. The final decision is always wholly up to the overseer, though.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, players determine what the water supply situation looks like. Should a plantation not be sufficiently watered, its production drops dramatically; should it happen more than once, then that plantation may revert to fallow ground. At game's end, naturally only the cultivated land counts. Each plantation is counted according to type &ndash; the bigger the better. But since the ownership markers play a role as well, the same plantation can give drastically different points for different players.&#10;&#10;";5;75;10;3;75;Santiago;75;2003;Oliver Freudenreich,Tomasz Larek;Farming,Negotiation;Claudia Hely,Roman Pelek;Country: Cape Verde;Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Commodity Speculation,Tile Placement;AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH,Ediciones Primigenio,Trefl,Z-Man Games;7.14923;4308;santiago;24;0.0;0.0;3.4761904761904767;0;0.0;RjkMBZ7G9l;False;0;5.0;75.0;10.0;3.0;75.0;Santiago;42;3-5;124;75;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;496;2003.0;santiago
260;3311;8217;"San Juan is a card game based on Puerto Rico. The deck of 110 cards consists of production buildings (indigo, sugar, tobacco, coffee, and silver) and &quot;violet&quot; buildings that grant special powers or extra victory points. Cards from the hand can be either built or used as money to build something else; cards from the deck are used to represent goods produced by the production buildings, in which case they are left face-down. A seven-card hand limit is enforced once per round.&#10;&#10;In each round (or governorship), each player in turn selects from one of the available roles, triggering an event that usually affects all players, such as producing goods or constructing buildings. The person who picks the role gets a privilege, such as producing more goods or building more cheaply.&#10;&#10;Though similar in concept to Puerto Rico, the game has many different mechanisms. In particular, the game includes no colonists and no shipping of goods; goods production and trading are normally limited to one card per phase; and trades cannot be blocked.

261;3312;8222;"Spank the Monkey is a fast-paced, humorous card game with sneaky tactics. All players are working in a junk yard where a teasing monkey has appeared. Your job is to climb up to the monkey and spank it.&#10;&#10;There are 5 types of cards in the game. Junk cards, like the totem pole, surfboard, and garden gnome, are used to pile on top of each other and form the &quot;board&quot; in front of each player. Each junk card has its own height, strength, and often a special ability when played. The combined height of your junk cards is used to see if you have reached the monkey. Some junk cards are a bit fragile, but they can be strengthened by reinforcement cards like duct tape, ivy, and a hired security guard. Each junk card also belongs to at least one category of which there are 7 in the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, you attack the junk card of other players in an attempt to make them fall down, or at least lower them a bit. There are three kind of attacks; throwing attacks (bowling ball, flock of seagulls, and dynamite) that you can use on any junk card, hand attacks (chainsaw, blind, and crowbar) that you can only use on cards at the same height as yourself, and the sneak attacks (lawyer, wasp&rsquo;s nest, and ball cannon) that all have special abilities.&#10;&#10;A die roll is used to solve the attack. You add the attack value of your attack card and compare it to the combined strength of the attacked junk card and any reinforcement cards it might have. The defending player may play defense cards that either lower the die roll (umbrella, satellite dish, and wok) or completely stop or redirect the attack (electric force field, tennis racket, and trampoline).&#10;&#10;If a junk card is destroyed, you have effectively lowered that player's height by the height of the card, and if there are junk cards above the destroyed card, they fall down, and the defender is forced to make a collision roll to see if the junk cards also are destroyed.&#10;&#10;The fifth card type is called special, and it is a kind of catchall for all the crazy special effect you may do in the game. There are all kinds of tricks, like giving you an extra turn, starting an earthquake, and having a police raid.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Monkey Business&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";6;30;12;2;30;Spank the Monkey;30;2003;Peter Svärd;Card Game,Fighting,Humor,Party Game;Peter Hansson;Animals: Apes / Monkeys;Dice Rolling,Modular Board;Black Book Editions,Gigantoskop,Vendetta;5.9584800000000016;1209;spank the monkey;83;0.0;0.0;2.833333333333333;0;0.0;ZE2rpQbJHs;False;0;6.0;45.0;8.0;2.0;15.0;Spank the Monkey;9;2-6;7;15-45;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;169;2003.0;spank the monkey
262;3313;8229;"In Nuggets (2003), players try to surround the &quot;gold mines&quot; (numbered cylinders) on an 8x5 grid board. On a turn, a player either places a numbered tile face down or places two fence sections on the board; these fences determine the borders of each claim, and each claim must be at least four spaces large. At the end of the game, all tiles are revealed, and each gold mine is awarded to the player whose tiles in that claim have the largest sum, with ties resulting in an equal division of points. Whoever collects the most mine points wins.&#10;&#10;Armad&ouml;ra (2013) uses the same gameplay as Nuggets for the base game, albeit with the players themed as orcs, elves, mages and goblins on the hunt for dwarven gold. Armod&ouml;ra also adds advanced rules to the game, with each player receiving one reinforcement token and 1-2 special power tokens. Instead of placing a warrior or erecting palisades (fences), a player can place a reinforcement token on one of his warriors in a territory that's already filled, boosting the strength of that warrior by one. A player can use his special power before taking one of the three normal actions, with the elf shooting an opposing warrior in an unfilled territory (lowering his strength by one), the orc placing an additional palisade that turn, the goblin placing a second warrior (with this one being face-up), and the mage looking at the value of an already placed opponent's warrior.&#10;&#10;";4;30;8;2;30;Armadöra;30;2003;Tony Rochon;Abstract Strategy,American West,Bluffing,Territory Building;Christwart Conrad;;Area Control / Area Influence,Area Enclosure,Tile Placement;Blackrock Games,Blue Orange Games,Jolly Thinkers,New Games Order, LLC,Winning Moves Germany,Zhiyanjia;6.41694;643;armadöra;13;0.0;0.0;3.055555555555556;0;0.12;tvPIYWQ4mc;False;0;4.0;30.0;8.0;2.0;30.0;Armadöra;9;2-4;54;30;21.95;0.0;0.0;0.0;162;2003.0;armadöra
263;3321;8273;"Alexandros is an abstract strategy by Leo Colovini, thematically inspired by the military expansion of Alexander the Great. It includes the &quot;triggered scoring for all&quot; mechanism, which can be considered a trademark of the designer, implemented in many of his games. It forces players to evaluate their actions in relation to what other players can earn.&#10;&#10;The goal of the game is to have more points than other players when the trail/border markers are depleted or someone scores 100 points first.&#10;&#10;Gameplay is driven by cards, used for all actions. Clockwise, players are first obliged to move the figure representing Alexandros across a triangular grid. They do this by playing cards with symbols matching those on destination spots. This is the core concept of the game - when the figure of Alexandros is moved, it leaves a trail of borders behind it. Soon, these borders begin to form provinces composed of triangular spaces: either with symbols or empty.&#10;&#10;After moving Alexandros, players either build their hand of cards by drawing them, take over provinces or trigger scorings if the situation on the board suits them.&#10;&#10;Players can occupy provinces by playing cards from their hand and placing tokens representing their leaders on spaces with corresponding symbols. When a scoring is triggered, provinces earn points equal to the number of empty spaces in them. Players can take over empty provinces and/or those occupied by other players. Each player has only four generals and placing them costs valuable cards - the game requires careful hand management and point-to-point movement - to create worthy provinces for scoring.&#10;&#10;Awarded title of &quot;Best Family Strategy Game&quot; by Games Magazine in 2005.&#10;&#10;";4;45;12;2;45;Alexandros;45;2003;Grafik Studio Krüger;Abstract Strategy,Ancient,Territory Building;Leo Colovini;Country: Greece;Area Enclosure,Hand Management,Point to Point Movement;Rio Grande Games,Winning Moves Germany;6.1951;847;alexandros;24;2.0;2.0;3.1428571428571432;0;0.34;uwafO6PxJz;False;0;4.0;45.0;12.0;2.0;27.0;Alexandros;7;2-4;6;27-45;32.99;0.0;0.0;0.0;94;2003.0;alexandros

268;3418;8730;"Flying Colors returns you to the age of sail where mighty men-o-war and Ships of the Line met in vast engagements for command of the sea.  Unlike many other games set in the period, Flying Colors provides a simple, fast-playing system allowing players to re-enact battles containing dozens of ships on each side.  Rather than focusing on the abilities of individual ships, Flying Colors uses broad classes of vessel within each &quot;rate&quot; and concentrates the players minds on maintaining command of their fleets using a simple command system.&#10;&#10;From the Publisher:&#10;Flying Colors recreates naval actions during the height of the Age of Sail, from small engagements to full battles involving dozens of ships in each fleet. Play is fast, furious, and does not require the pre-plotted movement found in many other naval games. Instead, a simple initiative and command system allows players to activate and maneuver their fleets in a realistic manner, indicating how older commanders adhered to rules of engagement where more forward thinking commanders, like Nelson, could retain control of their fleets after the first broadsides began to be exchanged.&#10;&#10;This is not a strategic level game where one piece represents several ships. Flying Colors includes 300 individually named ships rated for size, gunnery, boarding ability, and damage capacity. Also included are nearly four dozen individually named commanders, rated for their ability to control their formations as well as the impact of their presence within the fleet. The game system provides what naval enthusiasts will expect in a tactical Age of Sail game: broadsides, rakes, anchoring, wind effects, weather, shore batteries, and much more. All this is packed into a short, accessible rulebook.&#10;&#10;Included within the game are 17 historical scenarios ranging from the Battle of Minorca (1756) during the Seven Years War to the Battle of the Capes during the American Revolution and on through the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) during the Napoleonic Wars. The battles range in size from small engagements playable on a single map through huge engagements like the Glorious First of June playable on three maps. Players are also free to create their own variants and &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios using point values for each ship. Most scenarios can be played within a few hours and two players can complete even the largest within a day. Several are also well suited to solitarie play.&#10;&#10;You can now recreate Nelson's glory with Flying Colors!&#10;&#10;";4;240;12;1;240;Flying Colors;240;2005;Rodger B.

There are nine yellow plastic eggs and one yellow wooden egg (worth 2 points, the others are worth 1 point) and two dice, one red and one white. Although it is, in fact, a children's game, it is great fun when played by adults as well.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to accumulate the most points. First a player rolls the red die. Depending on the result of the die roll, players can:  attempt to be the first to take an egg from the box (or steal from someone else if there are none left in the box); drop an egg on the table and then compete to catch it; or even get up and run around the table to try to be the first back to their seat. When a player successfully wins an egg, he or she then rolls the white die, which indicates the location of the egg; between your cheek and your shoulder, your chin and the breast, between your knees, etc. When the first person drops an egg, the game ends and the one having the most points wins the game.&#10;&#10;Ages 5 and up&#10;&#10;";4;10;5;2;10;Dancing Eggs;10;2003;Martina Leykamm;Action / Dexterity,Children's Game,Dice,Humor,Party Game;Roberto Fraga;HABA Mitbringspiele series;Dice Rolling;HABA - Habermaaß GmbH;6.48652;1716;dancing eggs;25;0.0;0.0;3.0;0;0.4;eP4BwkH680;False;0;4.0;15.0;5.0;2.0;10.0;Dancing Eggs;26;2-4;136;10-15;11.99;0.0;0.0;0.0;309;2003.0;dancing eggs

276;3542;9446;"Blue Moon is a card game for two players, which has often been compared to Magic: The Gathering, although it has considerably different game mechanics. Particularly, it is not a CCG: There are no random cards in any expansion. It can thus be regarded as the first LCG, although it doesn't use that term yet.&#10;&#10;It is set in the fictional world of Blue Moon, where different peoples fight for dominance of the world and the favor of the Dragons.&#10;Each people has its own unique traits and gameplay mechanics, and is represented by a 30 card deck.&#10;&#10;The standard game box contains the 'Vulca' and the 'Hoax' decks, a small gameboard and three small plastic dragon miniatures, used as scoring counters in the game.&#10;&#10;Other decks can be bought separately as expansions with 31 or 30 cards each.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Rules overview from the official rules:&#10;&#10;The game consists of independent consecutive fights. The starting player begins the first fight.&#10;&#10;Each fight is contested in one of two elements, either fire or earth, as announced by the starting player of the fight.&#10;During each fight, players take alternate turns to play their cards building up power in their combat and support areas.&#10;Basically, each turn the players play a character card and possibly some additional cards to at least match the total&#10;power of their opponent, who must then in turn match his opponent&rsquo;s power, and so on. &ndash; If a player is unable to do&#10;this, he must retreat from the fight.&#10;&#10;A fight ends when one of the players retreats. The other player is the winner of the fight and attracts a number of&#10;dragons. Both players remove all their cards from their combat and support areas and place them onto their face up&#10;discard pile. The retreating player then starts the next fight.&#10;&#10;Usually, the game ends when one player runs out of cards and retreats from the last fight. Then the player with&#10;dragons on his side is the victor and scores some victory points (crystals).&#10;A player wins the game instantly if he has all three dragons on his side and then attracts further dragons.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Description from the publisher.&#10;&#10;The world of Blue Moon is in chaos.

278;3566;9625;"Struggle of Empires recreates the various wars fought between the European powers as they attempted to become the dominant force in Europe and the rest of the world during the eighteenth century.  Build armies and fleets, make alliances, establish colonies, improve your economy, and ultimately wage war to expand your empire.  Be careful, though, as a profligate country can end up being consumed by revolution.&#10;&#10;From the designer:&#10;Think of Civilization/Age of Renaissance set in the 18th century. Players take the role of one of the major powers of the period and fight in both Europe and the colonies. The twist to the game is that in each war, players must form into two alliances. Once allied with a player, you cannot fight each other. This means that you do not have the backstabbing of Diplomacy to worry about; if he's allied, he's with you until the end of the war. This means that a player has to think carefully about who he wants to fight against and who he wants to ally with. Very often he will want to ally with his natural enemy and go to war with the guy who doesn't really want to fight him. On top of this, you have lots of improvement tiles that you buy to shape your empire, plus alliances with minor powers, and the possibility of going into revolution. Even though it is a big empire building game, it will scale from 3 to 7 players and has pretty simple rules.&#10;&#10;";7;240;13;2;180;Struggle of Empires;240;2004;Peter Dennis;Age of Reason,Civilization,Fighting,Political,Territory Building;Martin Wallace;Admin: Better Description Needed!,Colonial Theme;Area Control / Area Influence,Area Movement,Auction/Bidding,Dice Rolling;Arclight,Eagle-Gryphon Games,Warfrog Games;7.51411;3406;struggle of empires;45;0.0;0.0;3.3648648648648645;0;-0.28;iXCBzvMqtt;False;0;7.0;210.0;13.0;2.0;180.0;Struggle of Empires;37;2-7;79;180-210;54.95;214.99;132.87;0.0;741;2004.0;struggle of empires

Victory Points are earned for the number of territories controlled + region bonuses + control of crypts and altars in the Underworld and for every relic that offers a territory bonus if that territory is controlled.&#10;&#10;Also like Risk 2210 A.D., the game begins with a number of territories out of play.

Get ready for laughter as your friends and family suddenly start sounding like they were born in a barn!&quot;&#10;&#10;In Snorta each player is given a plastic farm animal (cute cartoonishly-designed ones by John Kovalic). In a &quot;sound-off&quot; everyone makes their animal's sound, then hides it in their barn. All the animal cards are passed out. Each player quickly flips over cards into a face-up pile in front of them, going around the circle. When a card placed down matches one of the cards already on the table, those two players rush to say the animal sound of the other player. (You don't make the noise of the animal ON the card.) It's hard to remember everyone's animal under pressure, so this speed and memory game is lively and funny to play. If you say the other player's sound first, you give them all the cards you've flipped onto the table in front of you. They then add them to the bottom of their hand.

292;3827;11825;"(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Empire of the Sun (EotS) is Mark Herman's third card driven design since he introduced the system to the hobby in We The People. EotS is a strategic level look at the entire War in the Pacific from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the surrender of Japan. EotS is the first card driven game (CDG) to move the system closer to a classic hexagon wargame, while retaining all of the tension and uncertainty people have come to expect from a CDG. Players are cast in the role of MacArthur, Yamamoto, Nimitz, and Mountbatten as you direct your forces across the breadth of the globe from India to Hawaii and from Alaska to Australia. This is represented on a single map based on a 1942 equal area projection of the entire theater of conflict.&#10;&#10;As in other games using the CDG system, players try to maximize the impact of their cards even as they hide their intentions and traps from their opponent. The player is faced with a wide set of clear strategic choices. The focus of EotS is on directing major offensive axes of advance. The Japanese early in the game are challenged to achieve their historical expansion as Allied forces battle the clock to react with their in-place forces trying to achieve maximum damage to the hard-to-replace Japanese veteran units.&#10;&#10;Combat in EotS is based on successfully bringing superior combined land, air, and sea forces to bear in a two-tiered combat system. The first tier is the resolution of air-naval combat, the second tier covers ground combat. The culmination of both tiers results in one side prevailing in battle.&#10;&#10;The key variable in determining strategic victory is the level of U.S. political will. The Japanese win the game by forcing the U.S. into a negotiated peace, which was not achieved historically. The Japanese achieve this by knocking countries like India, China, and Australia out of the war, while inflicting massive casualties on the United States. The delivery of the A-bomb on its historical schedule is not a guarantee, often necessitating Operation Olympic and the invasion of Japan. It is often in its darkest hour that the Japanese find victory in EotS.&#10;EotS scenarios were designed with the busy enthusiast, grognard, and competitive tournament player in mind. EotS was designed to be played n yearly scenarios (1942, 1943, and 1944) of three turns each that play in under two hours. If you are a fan of CDG's, EotS takes the genre into a familiar, but new direction. If you are a fan of classic hexagon wargames, this game has all of the features that brought you to this hobby in the first place, but with a new level of excitement and replayability. The game is comprehensive, but easy to learn.&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE: 4 months per turn&#10;MAP SCALE: 150 miles per hex&#10;UNIT SCALE: Brigade, Division, Corps, and Army&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Mark Herman&#10;DEVELOPER: Stephen Newberg&#10;MAP &amp; CARD ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch, Dave Lawrence, &amp; Rodger B. MacGowan&#10;&#10;&#10;(from the designer:)&#10;&#10;Empire of the Sun (EOTS), uses a variant of my card driven system. The game has one map that covers the Pacific Theater of operations from India to Hawaii, and from the Aleutians to Australia. EOTS is the first card driven game to use hexes, which facilitates calculating movement and aircraft ranges. Each game turn covers 4 months (three turns per year) with a special December 41 (special two card) game turn, for a total of 12 game turns for the campaign.&#10;&#10;The game is at the strategic level using naval units built around a capital ship class (e.g., CV Wasp, BB Washington, etc.), air units at the Air Force/ Air Flotilla/ Air Division level, and most ground units are Corps/ Armies although there are a host of specialized units at the division and below level. The game has 165 cards divided into an Allied and a Japanese deck.&#10;&#10;The game uses a two tiered combat system with air-naval combat preceding ground combat. The system has players roll for combat efficiency, which is a strength multiplier from .5 to 2. This value multiplied by the unit strengths is the number of hits the enemy takes in combat, with some special conditions based on number of CVs present and the like.&#10;&#10;As far as game play is concerned, China is abstracted using a track whereby the play of certain events and Chinese offensives puts pressure on the Allies to support this theater with resources or see it fall and hurt Allied morale. This is balanced against the fact that Japanese land replacements come from this theater, so the more they draw it down for conflict in other locations, the more likely China will survive.&#10;&#10;Northern India and Burma are active theaters of operation where the majority of the continuous ground warfare in the game occurs. If the Japanese can successfully occupy Northern India, they can drive this nation and its Commonwealth units out of the war.&#10;&#10;Australia can also be knocked out of the war, although it is hard to keep it out permanently.&#10;&#10;Then of course there is the famous island campaigns with the US driving across the Pacific to knock Japan out of the war.&#10;&#10;";2;360;12;1;360;Empire of the Sun;360;2005;Dave Lawrence,Rodger B.

293;3840;11971;"Cockroach Poker is a reverse set collection game that has nothing to do with poker &ndash; except that the game is all about bluffing, but with cards that show cockroaches, rats and stink bugs instead of queens, 10s and aces. The goal of the game is to force another player to collect 4 of any one type of critter.&#10;&#10;The deck includes 64 cards, with eight copies of eight types of critters. To set up the game, shuffle the deck and deal the cards out to players.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player takes one card from his hand, lays it face down on the table, slides it to a player of his choice, and declares a type of critter, e.g., &quot;Stink bug&quot;. The player receiving the card either&#10;&#10;&bull; Accepts the card, says either &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;, then reveals the card.

The players are traders in this day, competing to be the first to earn 60 gold by buying and selling tea, hide, fruits, salt, silk, and trinkets.  The game is played with cards which allow players to buy and sell goods, can help you or hinder your opponent, and others which add a bit of spice to the game.  Return to the dark continent where the players alternate turns with up to 5 actions each until one player reaches the goal and wins the game.&quot;&#10;&#10;Original description from Games4You.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of merchants offering their wares from market stands. On a player's turn, he has five actions to choose from. Actions can be used to draw cards, play cards and activate buildup cards.&#10;&#10;In order to sell wares, the merchants must first lay the wares out, since customers will only buy where all the wares they want are being offered. And since market space is at a premium, players have to think hard about which wares to offer.&#10;&#10;By owning important buildup cards and properly using the assets of other village inhabitants, the merchants succeed in attracting especially many customers to their stalls, making bargain buys, and messing with their opponents' plans.&#10;&#10;The first player to reach a set cash level through buying and selling of wares is the winner.&#10;&#10;The game's attraction lies with the many special cards.

Each card comes with an extra (getting to be first player in the next round, for example). Then he decides whether to travel to the next city. Does he want to wait until the next round in hopes of better cards, or will he make his journey now? If so, he must have and play the required travel cards. The two transportation types are trains and ships. For example, 2 ship cards are required to travel from Suez to Bombay, so 2 ship cards must be played; train cards won't help in this instance. Time is spent each step of the way in the form of days, and (while meeting certain other requirements) the winner is the player who spends the fewest number of days getting around the world. The number of days depends on the travel cards used, plus help from special cards, hindrance from the meandering detective, and so on.&#10;&#10;";6;70;10;2;50;Around the World in 80 Days;70;2004;Dirk Hoffmann,Franz Vohwinkel,Bernd Wagenfeld;Novel-based,Racing,Travel;Michael Rieneck;Jules Verne's novels,Kosmos Literature Series;Card Drafting,Hand Management,Point to Point Movement,Time Track;Competo / Marektoy,Devir,Galakta,Kaissa Chess & Games,KOSMOS,MINDOK,Piatnik,Rio Grande Games,University Games,Zvezda;6.58639;2684;around the world in 80 days;30;0.0;0.0;3.0583333333333336;0;0.0;iS9pFPDEmW;True;0;4.0;70.0;10.0;2.0;50.0;Around the World in 80 Days;30;2-4;85;50-70;0.0;0.0;51.95;0.0;196;2004.0;around the world in 80 days
296;3885;12333;"&quot;Now the trumpet summons us again, not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need; not as a call to battle, though embattled we are &ndash; but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle...&quot;&#10;&ndash; John F. Kennedy&#10;&#10;In 1945, unlikely allies toppled Hitler's war machine, while humanity's most devastating weapons forced the Japanese Empire to its knees in a storm of fire. Where once there stood many great powers, there then stood only two. The world had scant months to sigh its collective relief before a new conflict threatened. Unlike the titanic struggles of the preceding decades, this conflict would be waged not primarily by soldiers and tanks, but by spies and politicians, scientists and intellectuals, artists and traitors. Twilight Struggle is a two-player game simulating the forty-five year  dance of intrigue, prestige, and occasional flares of warfare between the Soviet Union and the United States. The entire world is the stage on which these two titans fight to make the world safe for their own ideologies and ways of life. The game begins amidst the ruins of Europe as the two new &quot;superpowers&quot; scramble over the wreckage of the Second World War, and ends in 1989, when only the United States remained standing.&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle inherits its fundamental systems from the card-driven classics We the People and Hannibal: Rome vs. Carthage. It is a quick-playing, low-complexity game in that tradition. The game map is a world map of the period, whereon players move units and exert influence in attempts to gain allies and control for their superpower. As with GMT's other card-driven games, decision-making is a challenge; how to best use one's cards and units given consistently limited resources?&#10;&#10;Twilight Struggle's Event cards add detail and flavor to the game. They cover a vast array of historical happenings, from the Arab-Israeli conflicts of 1948 and 1967, to Vietnam and the U.S. peace movement, to the Cuban Missile Crisis and other such incidents that brought the world to the brink of nuclear annihilation. Subsystems capture the prestige-laden Space Race as well as nuclear tensions, with the possibility of game-ending nuclear war.&#10;&#10;Components (original edition):&#10;&#10;&#10;     228 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; full colour map &#10;     103 event cards &#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;Components (2009 Deluxe edition and after)&#10;&#10;     260 full colour counters &#10;     22&quot;x34&quot; mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     110 event cards&#10;     2 six-sided dice&#10;     1 24-page rulebook&#10;     2 full colour player aid cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;TIME SCALE:     approx. 3-5 years per turn&#10;MAP SCALE:     Point-to-point system&#10;UNIT SCALE:     Influence markers&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS:     2&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Ananda Gupta &amp; Jason Matthews&#10;MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;A deluxe edition, published in 2009 includes the following changes from the basic game:&#10;&#10;     Mounted map with revised graphics&#10;     Two double-thick counter sheets with 260 counters&#10;     Deck of 110 event cards (increased from 103)&#10;     Revised rules and player aid cards&#10;     Revised at start setup and text change for card #98 Aldrich Ames&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Upgrade kit for the owners of the previous version includes the following:&#10;&#10;     Mounted Map with revised graphics&#10;     New card decks&#10;     Updated Rules &amp; Charts&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";2;180;13;2;180;Twilight Struggle;180;2005;Viktor Csete,Rodger B.

Using polyp tiles, players grow different types of corals, which they can protect from being attacked by other corals through judicious placing of their four shrimp counters. To be successful players must consume polyps from neighboring corals in order to acquire the 'consumed' polyp tiles that are the key to the game. The consumed polyp tiles have a myriad of uses (and have a similar effect to the action points in games like Tikal and Java). Most importantly they can be used to flip over or lock the coral tiles, which determine the respective values of the different types of coral at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Description from the designer, Richard Breese.&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;    Reef Encounter of the Second Kind&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";4;120;10;2;60;Reef Encounter;120;2004;Juliet Breese,Mariano Iannelli;Animals,Environmental,Territory Building;Richard Breese;Animals: Fishes;Area Control / Area Influence,Card Drafting,Commodity Speculation,Hand Management,Tile Placement;Quined Games,R&D Games,What's Your Game?,Z-Man Games;7.170889999999999;4598;reef encounter;45;0.0;0.0;3.6836734693877538;0;0.0;MW5xCKEnNl;False;0;4.0;120.0;10.0;2.0;60.0;Reef Encounter;49;2-4;202;60-120;0.0;0.0;42.95;0.0;467;2004.0;reef encounter

So far nobody has dreamed of the danger that will bury all of their dreams under mountains of ash just ten years later. Who will survive the eruption of Vesuvius unscathed?&#10;&#10;The simple rules make it easy to get started with The Downfall of Pompeii, a game in which a lot of tactical know-how is required &ndash; along with a little luck &ndash; in order to bring your pieces out of the city at the right time.&#10;&#10;The game falls into two halves: before and after the eruption of Vesuvius. Before the eruption, players play cards to place their pieces in buildings. After the first eruption, they can also place as many relatives as the number of pieces already in the building they placed their piece in. When Omen cards are drawn, the player can take any opponent's piece and throw it into the erupting volcano. In this manner, players try to get as many pieces onto the board as close to the exits from the city as possible.&#10;&#10;After the second eruption, the game changes. Now each player places a lava tile, which kills any pieces on that square and may block exits from the city. Then they move two pieces toward the exits, moving them a number of squares equal to the pieces on the square from which they started. The player who gets the most pieces out of the city wins.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;The 2013 second edition of The Downfall of Pompeii includes three dual vent tiles and a new &quot;Dual Vent&quot; variant.&#10;&#10;";4;45;10;2;45;The Downfall of Pompeii;45;2004;Oliver Freudenreich,Guido Hoffmann;Ancient;Klaus-Jürgen Wrede;Ancient Rome,Cities: Pompeii;Grid Movement,Hand Management,Tile Placement;AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH,Maldito Games,Mayfair Games;7.13895;5969;the downfall of pompeii;24;0.0;0.0;3.452097902097904;0;0.36;QvLef7AYCX;False;0;4.0;150.0;10.0;2.0;45.0;The Downfall of Pompeii;91;2-4;408;45-150;44.99;0.0;32.97;0.0;1522;2004.0;the downfall of pompeii

Or you can choose to adore Santa Maria, the most powerful saint of all -- but you'll be expected to build a civilization twice as impressive as any other player.&#10;&#10;While your economy is constantly improving, with more and more advanced cities bringing new options each turn, the land around your cities is slowly being depleted, forcing you to travel further and further to gather your raw materials -- until finally, there is no more land left to farm.

310;4120;14701;"(from the designer:)&#10;&#10;The Price of Freedom: The American Civil War, 1861-65 is Renaud Verlaque's second published design after Age of Napoleon, winner of 2003 Best Pre-WW2 Historical Boardgame CSR award.&#10;&#10;The Price of Freedom is a true grand-strategic-level look at the American Civil War. Using an original card-driven system, it provides strong historical flavor in a simple game that can consistently be played in three hours. This makes The Price of Freedom an ideal game for today's gamer's busy lifestyle, as well as for tournaments.&#10;&#10;As you might expect from a quick-playing game, counter density in The Price of Freedom is purposefully low and is also constrained by each side&rsquo;s War Effort level, an aggregate measure of economic, political and diplomatic support for the war. Each military game piece represents a &quot;corps&quot; of 20-30,000 men. Corps must organized into armies led by the colorful commanders that every American Civil War aficionado has come to love or hate. Twenty-five historical army commanders are available for theater or field command, from Ben &quot;Spoons&quot; Butler to &quot;Massa&quot; Robert E. Lee, with each commander rated -1, 0 or +1 for offense, defense and movement.  Armies move and fight on a functional and yet very attractive point-to-point representation of the Eastern and Western theaters, vying to capture or defend critical territory or simply to beat each other out.&#10;&#10;The card-driven engine ensures that no game of The Price of Freedom is ever the same as another and that there are plenty of hard choices to make in each campaign impulse. The game uses a well-balanced deck of 55 cards that are all playable by both sides. Each card has two uses that are generally mutually exclusive: either it can be used by spending its operational value (ranging 1-3) on various actions (moving, reorganizing or reinforcing armies) or it can be used to implement the event described on the card. Events can affect army leadership (Commander-in-Chief, Clash of Egos, Shot from the Saddle) or battle resolution (Blundering Fool; Seeing the Elephant; Bickering Generals; etc.), help gain operational advantage (Strategic Transfer; Turning Movement; Interior Lines), or simulate major political, economic or diplomatic events (Draft; Kentucky; Blockade; etc.). Like overall army size, hand size is dictated by each side's War Effort level.&#10;&#10;The Union player can win by driving down the Confederate War Effort level low enough or by vastly outnumbering Confederate troops. The Confederate player can win in similar fashion or by hanging long and well enough to cause Lincoln to lose the 1864 elections or prevent the Union player from achieving the historical outcome.&#10;&#10;So convene your cabinet, call up your generals, muster your troops, it is time to fight and find out what is the true Price of Freedom!&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;(from Compass Games website:)Components:&#10;    1 25&quot;x19&quot; cardstock map&#10;    132 counters&#10;    1 deck of 55 playing cards&#10;    2 player-aid cards&#10;    1 rules booklet&#10;    2 6-sided dice&#10;    1 full color box and lid&#10;&#10;";2;120;12;2;120;The Price of Freedom: The American Civil War 1861-1865;120;2008;Brien J.

316;4185;15512;"Diamant &mdash; also published as Incan Gold &mdash; is a quick, fun press-your-luck game. Players venture down mine shafts or explore paths in the jungle by turning up cards from a deck and evenly sharing the gems they find on the way, with any leftover gems being placed on the card. Before the next card is revealed, you have the chance to leave the mine and stash your holdings, including any gems you get on the way out.&#10;&#10;Why would you leave? Because the deck also contains hazards: scorpions, snakes, poison gas, explosions and rockfalls. When a particular hazard is revealed for the second time (e.g., a second scorpion), anyone still in the shaft or on the path has to drop all the gems they've collected that round and flee for safety. The trick is that as more players leave each turn, your share of the pie grows larger, which will perhaps inspire you to explore deeper &mdash; but at the risk of ending up with nothing.&#10;&#10;All editions of Incan Gold and later editions of Diamant include five artifact cards that are shuffled into the deck of gem and hazard cards, either one per round or all at once. When an artifact card is revealed, no on can take this card and it's placed on the path. If exactly one player leaves at the end of a turn, they collect not only all gems that remain on the path, but the artifact as well, which is worth points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";8;30;8;3;30;Diamant;30;2005;Jörg Asselborn,Paul Mafayon,Claus Stephan,Christof Tisch;Adventure,Bluffing;Bruno Faidutti,Alan R.

Players explore the unknown ocean around them, hoping to discover the most lucrative island groups, and colonize them. They build canoes and train warriors to create a force to defend their empire, while forging lines of communication with their developing discoveries. Resources are scarce; using them wisely is a key to victory. Investing in exploration widens your empire. Building warriors strengthens your empire. Investing resources into cultural innovations can yield unexpected dividends, like tattooing, hula dancing, surfing, or even the giant moai statues of Easter Island fame.&#10;&#10;Conquest of Paradise is a well-tested, fast-playing design geared to appeal to players who enjoy games like New World, Civilization, and Conquistador. You can learn the game in 10-15 minutes and finish a complete game in 60-90 minutes.&#10;&#10;Conquest of Paradise is a game of exploration and empire building, but also (as you'd expect from a GMT game) CONFLICT.

320;4266;16986;"In Ubongo, players compete to solve individual puzzles as quickly as they can to get first crack at the gems on hand for the taking.&#10;&#10;Original edition:&#10;The game board consists of six rows, with twelve gems (of various colors) placed in these rows. At the start of play, each player places his pawn in front of one of those rows. Each player also takes twelve polyominoes &mdash; that is, pieces consisting of 2-5 squares in some configuration; players use these pieces each round to try to recreate shapes.&#10;&#10;At the start of a round, each player receives a puzzle card that depicts a shape created by some number of squares; one side of this card depicts six rows of 3 pieces, the other side depicts six rows of 4 pieces, for a more difficult puzzle. When everyone is ready, someone rolls a die to determine which row of pieces each player can use to recreate the shape on their individual card. The race is timed by a sand timer, and the outcome of this race determines the action on the main playing board.&#10;&#10;Whoever first solves their puzzle in time gets to move their pawn up to three rows left or right, with the second player to finish moving two rows and the third player only one row. Players then collect two gems from the front of the row where their pawn is located, which means that the more rows you can move, the more control you have over which color gems you can collect. After collecting gems, each player receives a new puzzle card, and a new round begins.&#10;&#10;After nine rounds, the game ends and whoever has collected the most gems in a single color wins! If players tie, then those players compare who has the most gems in a second color, and so on.&#10;&#10;2015 edition:&#10;The puzzle-part of the game remains the same, but the scoring track and system has been greatly changed, to be the same as in Ubongo Extreme. There are no pawns anymore, but instead the winner takes a 3-point gem plus a random gem, the second-place player takes a 1-point gem plus a random gem, and others who finish within time take just a random gem.

321;4268;16992;"From the publisher:&#10;&#10;A beautiful and beautifully simple game of laying a tile before your own token to continue its path on each turn.  The goal is to keep your token on the board longer than anyone else's, but as the board fills up this becomes harder because there are fewer empty spaces left... and another player's tile may also extend your own path in a direction you'd rather not go.  Easy to introduce to new players, Tsuro lasts a mere 15 minutes and actually does work for any number from 2 to 8.&#10;&#10;Theme:&#10;&#10;Tsuro has an Asian spiritual theme - the lines representing the &quot;many roads that lead to divine wisdom&quot;, and the game as a whole representing &quot;the classic quest for enlightenment&quot;.&#10;&#10;This theme is very light and the game essentially plays as an abstract.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The game consists of tiles with twisting lines on them, a 6x6 grid on which to lay these tiles and a token for each player. Each player has a hand of tiles. On your turn you do two things: place a tile from your hand onto the board next to your token and move your token as far as it can go along the line it is currently on, until it is stopped by an empty space with no tile in (yet), the edge of the board or colliding with another player's token. If your token reaches the edge of the board or collides with another player's token, you are out of the game. The aim of the game is to be the last player left with a token on the board. Strategy therefore consists of trying to drive your opponents either into each other or off the board whilst extending your own route in directions that will make it difficult for your opponents to do the same.&#10;&#10;Other notes:&#10;&#10;Tsuro was originally patented by McMurchie in 1979 under the name Squiggle Game, but was apparently not published at that time.

322;4271;17025;"In Friday the 13th, also available over the years as Poison and Baker's Dozen, players try to avoid bad luck by not taking cards from the central playing area each round. The more you take, the worse your score &mdash; unless you manage to take the most of one suit, in which case you get to throw those cards away!&#10;&#10;In a round, each player gets a hand of cards, with the cards coming in three suits that have values from 1 to 7 and a fourth &quot;joker&quot; suit in which all the cards have a value of 4. On a turn, a player discards a card from her hand onto a pile of the appropriate color (with jokers being playable on any pile) and gives the sum of all cards now in that pile. If the sum is higher than 13, then the player must first take all of the cards already in the pile, leaving only her card behind.&#10;&#10;The round ends once all the cards have been played, then players compare how many cards they have in each of the three suits; whoever has the most cards throws them away, while everyone else scores 1 penalty point per card. Each joker is worth 2 penalty points. Whoever has the fewest penalty points after each player has started a round once wins!&#10;&#10;";6;30;8;3;30;Friday the 13th;30;2005;Jessica R. E.

The Pancake Queen, the Ladybug Queen, and ten of their closest friends have fallen under a sleeping spell and it's your job to wake them up.&#10;&#10;In Sleeping Queens, players need to use strategy, quick thinking, and a little luck to rouse these napping nobles from their royal slumbers. The twelve queen cards lie face-down on the table. On a turn, you take one action from the cards in your hand: play a king to awaken and claim a sleeping queen, play a knight to steal someone else's queen (unless she has a dragon for protection), play a wand to send a queen to sleep once again, use a jester to try our luck with the top of the deck, or discard one or more number cards to draw more cards. Each queen card has a point value on it, and whenever all the queen have been awakened or one player hits the point threshold, the game ends and whoever has the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";5;10;8;2;10;Sleeping Queens;10;2005;Jimmy Pickering;Bluffing,Card Game,Children's Game,Deduction,Educational,Fantasy,Math,Memory,Mythology,Number;Miranda Evarts;;Hand Management,Memory,Set Collection,Take That,Trick-taking;Gamewright,Cocktail Games,FoxMind Israel,Game Factory,Grow Jogos e Brinquedos,Kanga Games,Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd,Oliphante,REBEL.pl,White Goblin Games;6.41306;1565;sleeping queens;53;0.0;0.0;3.0425531914893615;1;0.09;3OqyYCg8km;False;0;5.0;30.0;8.0;2.0;15.0;Sleeping Queens;47;2-5;581;15-30;9.99;16.0;16.95;9.93;404;2005.0;sleeping queens

325;4281;17133;"Railways of the World (2009) is the new edition of the base game for Eagle Games' popular Railways of the World series, first published as Railroad Tycoon in 2005.  It reimplements the original game with several improvements.&#10;&#10;Revisit the early days of the Age of Steam as you begin with a locomotive (the venerable John Bull, the first locomotive to run in North America) and a vision (your Tycoon &quot;mission&quot; card). From there, build your budding railroad network into a vast empire. Connect New York to Chicago, earn the most money, develop bigger and faster locomotives and maybe even span North America and build the Transcontinental Railway!&#10;&#10;Multiple expansions featuring different maps are available.  Railways of the World is the new base game for the system and includes the engine placards, railroad tiles, train tokens, money, bonds, and other items that are needed in almost all the Railways of the World series. A gameboard depicting the eastern half of the United States is included in the base game, as well as a mounted map of Mexico.&#10;&#10;This game is preceded by the designer's other Winsome train games: Age of Steam, Australian Railways, Volldampf, New England Railways, Veld Spoorweg, Lancashire Railways, and Ferrocarriles Pampas.  Railroad Tycoon was the result of a collaboration with Glenn Drover, in which the mechanics and game-play of Martin Wallace's Age of Steam were simplified and streamlined and attractive over-produced components were added, in order to make Railroad Tycoon more appealing to less hardcore gamers and more accessible to a wider audience.&#10;&#10;A revised reprint was published at the end of 2010 which made some component improvements, such as the addition of Railroad Operation cards for the Mexico map.&#10;&#10;Complete series overview - The Railways of the World Series: Introducing the family members of the ideal medium-weight train game&#10;&#10;Note: The RailRoad Tycoon board itself is gigantic (about 36x45 inches, 91x114 cm) and requires a huge table or playing on the floor.&#10;&#10;Similar to:&#10;&#10;     Steam&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";6;120;10;2;120;Railways of the World;120;2005;Kurt Miller,Paul Niemeyer,David Oram;Trains,Transportation,Video Game Theme;Glenn Drover,Martin Wallace;Age of Steam,Country: USA,Railways of the World series;Action Point Allowance System,Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Pick-up and Deliver,Route/Network Building,Tile Placement;Eagle-Gryphon Games,Edge Entertainment,Winsome Games;7.7052;9419;railways of the world;8;0.0;0.0;3.6042942942942946;0;0.3;754qbigK4J;False;0;6.0;120.0;10.0;2.0;120.0;Railways of the World;111;2-6;542;120;69.99;160.0;116.99;0.0;1411;2005.0;railways of the world

327;4302;17392;"Here I Stand: Wars of the Reformation 1517-1555 is the first game in over 25 years to cover the political and religious conflicts of early 16th Century Europe. Few realize that the greatest feats of Martin Luther, John Calvin, Ignatius of Loyola, Henry VIII, Charles V, Francis I, Suleiman the Magnificent, Ferdinand Magellan, Hern&aacute;n Cort&eacute;s, and Nicolaus Copernicus all fall within this narrow 40-year period of history. This game covers all the action of the period using a unique card-driven game system that models both the political and religious conflicts of the period on a single point-to-point map.&#10;&#10;There are six main powers in the game, each with a unique path to victory:&#10;&#10;    The Ottomans&#10;    The Habsburgs&#10;    The English&#10;    The Valois Dynasty of France&#10;    The Papacy&#10;    The Protestants&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Here I Stand is the first card-driven game to prominently feature secret deal-making. A true six-sided diplomatic struggle, the game places a heavy emphasis on successful alliance-building through negotiations that occur away from the table during the pre-turn Diplomacy Phase. Set during the period in which Niccol&ograve; Machiavelli published his masterpiece &quot;The Prince,&quot; backstabbing is always possible, especially because the card deck is loaded with event and response cards that can be played by any power to disrupt the plans of the powers in the lead.&#10;&#10;Here I Stand integrates religion, politics, economics, and diplomacy in a card-driven design. Games vary in length from 3&ndash;4 hours for a tournament scenario up to full campaign games that run about twice the time. Rules to play games with 3, 4, or 5 players are also included. The 3-player game is just as well balanced as the standard 6-player configuration, taking advantage of the natural alliances of the period.&#10;&#10;Game Components:&#10;&#10;    Four full-color counter sheets &#10;    One 22&quot; &times; 34&quot; full-color mapsheet (Deluxe edition: Mounted Mapboard)&#10;    110 Strategy cards &#10;    Ten 6-sided dice &#10;    32-page Rulebook&#10;    24-page Campaign Manual &#10;    Six 8.5&quot; &times; 5.5&quot; Power Cards &#10;    Two Player Aid Cards (two-sided) Game Features&#10;    The 2010 Deluxe Edition also contains the 2-player variant rules and cards&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";6;360;12;2;360;Here I Stand;360;2006;Rodger B.

A Drinking Man's Thinking Game can be played as a drinking game, or other methods of 'penalties' can be agreed upon by players prior to game play.  The cards also feature traditional poker symbols, so the cards may be used to play games such as Texas Hold 'Em, Poker, or a Wench variation utilizing the card mechanics.  Cards have 3 different categories, Stein (table cards), Barley (played only on a player's turn) and Wing (which can fly out of a player's hand at any time).  The game involves remembering what cards your opponents have that they may have shown during the game, or tricking them into breaking one of your rules or a rule that is in play so they must pay a penalty, and you can remove a card from your hand. The object of the game is to remove all cards from your hand and go 'out,' thereby making the player at the end of the night, who accumulated the most points, The Wench of the evening.  They will then have to pay an agreed upon punishment such as buy the beer or pizza, take out the garbage, etc.&#10;&#10;";5;25;18;3;25;Wench;25;2005;Monte Moore;Card Game,Humor,Mature / Adult,Memory;Shaun Cranford,Monte Moore;;Hand Management,Memory;Eagle-Gryphon Games,MYNDzei Games, llc.;4.56803;204;wench;41;0.0;0.0;3.0;0;0.0;AXKdjuNH4b;False;0;5.0;25.0;18.0;3.0;25.0;Wench;1;3-5;0;25;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;143;2005.0;wench

331;4342;17851;"The players decide whether they want to play the standard four-quarters football game or one of three scenarios. The scenarios put the offensive player in an on-field situation. When the offensive player scores or is forced to surrender the ball after failing to score, the players exchange roles and the new offensive player plays under identical conditions.&#10;&#10;Play action begins with the defensive player secretly chooses a die. The color of the die determines the defensive stand: against the running play, a short pass or a long pass. The offensive player then announces which of the three plays will be enacted. Defense rolls the die. Offense rolls three dice. Each player checks the appropriate table for results. The higher the number rolled by the players, the more effective their choices were, generally.&#10;&#10;Pizza Box Football is shaped like a pizza box... and it opens up into a head-to-head football strategy game designed to offer all the intensity of real football in every play. Players unfold the game board (the field) and lay it inside the unfolded pizza box. The cards guide the players as they play and show the players which dice to roll.&#10;&#10;Players must apply football strategy in order to win (when to run, when to short pass, when to long pass and when to try to fool the other team). Also available are additional plays from the expansion (sold separately) that extend the offensive strategy to include draws, screen passes and play-action passes and add run blitzes, route jumps and QB blitzes for the defense.  These plays work with the existing PBF game.  (The full expansion features 32 teams with different strengths on offense and on defense.)&#10;&#10;Pizza Box Football lets players feel like a coach, a player and a fan all at once.

334;4370;18100;"China is an abstracted game of political influence in China. Players use cards to place pieces (Houses or Emissaries) into the nine regions on the board. When all house spaces in a region are filled (or at the end of the game), players score for majorities of houses in that region. At game end, players then score for having majorities of emissaries in two adjacent regions. Players also score for having four or more houses in an uninterrupted sequence along one of the roads on the board.&#10;&#10;This fascinating game of domination combines multiple tactical possibilities with simple-to-learn rules and a short playing time!&#10;&#10;Even today in China, the unmistakable evidence of a fascinating story is everywhere. Hundreds of years ago, the country teetered on the brink of a change in power. Regional rulers fought continuously with each other with only one goal in mind: to become the new Emperor. They erected imposing houses and sent their emissaries to the regional courts.&#10;&#10;China is based on the award-winning game Web of Power by master game designer Michael Schacht. China differs from Web of Power in that there is no &quot;half-time&quot; scoring of regions as there is in the earlier game; there are four face-up cards to draw from instead of just two; and all adjacent regions have Emissary scoring opportunities, whereas in Web of Power, some adjacent regions did not. &#10;A special variant with fortifications is included.&#10;&#10;Aside from these differences, the two games are essentially the same.&#10;&#10;Online Play&#10;&#10;&#10;     http://www.boardgames-online.net (turn-based)&#10;&#10;&#10;implemented bonus maps: Web of Power, Hellenia, Skandinavia, America, AD 850, Life on Mars, Big in Japan&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Web of Power&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Expanded by:&#10;&#10;&#10;    China - Das Duell (Two-player variant)&#10;    China Erweiterung&#10;    China: Grenzstreitigkeiten&#10;    China Einflusskarten&#10;    China: The Embassies&#10;&#10;&#10;";5;45;12;3;45;China;45;2005;Michael Schacht;Ancient,Territory Building;Michael Schacht;Asian Theme,Country: China,Web of Power / China;Area Control / Area Influence,Card Drafting,Hand Management,Route/Network Building;ABACUSSPIELE,Überplay;7.03428;3966;china;39;0.0;0.0;3.354166666666666;0;0.0;sKPSMEklpe;False;0;5.0;45.0;12.0;3.0;45.0;China;36;3-5;154;45;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;247;2005.0;china

It has frogs and snakes and trees and fish and spiders and rabbits and mice and mushrooms and worms. It has air and water and dirt, and it has the humans whose pollution can endanger such things. It has all the standard new rules and actions that make it Fluxx, plus a few new ones that go with the theme, including the Composting rule (which lets you draw from the bottom of the discard pile) and new types of &quot;eating&quot; goals (which let you win the game if your Keeper says it eats one of the other Keepers in play).&#10;&#10;Fluxx is a card game in which the cards themselves determine the current rules of the game. At the start of the game, each player holds three cards and on a turn a player draws one card, then plays one card. By playing cards, you can put new rules into play that change numerous aspects of the game: how many cards to draw or play, how many cards you can hold in hand or keep on the table in front of you, and (most importantly) how to win the game.&#10;&#10;Nature Fluxx features the same cards and gameplay as EcoFluxx, but with updated card frame art and packaging.&#10;&#10;";6;15;8;2;15;Nature Fluxx;15;2005;Alison Frane,Andrew Looney,Derek Ring;Card Game;Alison Frane,Andrew Looney;Fluxx,Global warming;Hand Management,Set Collection;Looney Labs;5.84964;860;nature fluxx;75;0.0;0.0;3.0;0;0.3;v8v7PA8JB8;False;0;6.0;30.0;8.0;2.0;18.0;Nature Fluxx;12;2-6;14;18-30;11.17;26.99;14.28;9.0;91;2005.0;nature fluxx

337;4395;18602;"Once upon a time ...&#10;1289. To strengthen the borders of the Kingdom of France, King Philip the Fair decided to have a new castle built. For the time being, Caylus is but a humble village, but soon, workers and craftsmen will be flocking by the cartload, attracted by the great prospects. Around the building site, a city is slowly rising up.&#10;&#10;The players embody master builders. By building the King's castle and developing the city around it, they earn prestige points and gain the King's favor. When the castle is finished, the player who has earned the most prestige wins the game.  The expansion Caylus Expansion: The Jeweller was included in the 2nd Edition.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players pay to place their workers in various buildings in the village. These buildings allow players to gather resources or money, or to build or upgrade buildings with those resources. Players can also use their resources to help build the castle itself, earning points and favors from the king, which provide larger bonuses. Building a building provides some immediate points, and potentially income throughout the game, since players receive bonuses when others use their buildings. The buildings chosen by the players have a heavy impact on the course of the game, since they determine the actions that will be available to all the players.&#10;&#10;As new buildings are built, they stretch along a road stretching away from the castle, and not all buildings can be used every turn. Players have some control over which buildings are active by paying to influence the movement of the Provost marker. The final position of the marker is the newest building that can be used that turn. The Provost marker also helps determine the movement of the Bailiff marker, which determines the end of the game. Generally, if players are building many buildings and the Provost is generous in allowing them to be used, the game ends more quickly.&#10;&#10;";5;150;12;2;60;Caylus;150;2005;Cyril Demaegd,Arnaud Demaegd,Mike Doyle (I);City Building,Economic,Medieval;William Attia;Caylus,Country: France,Ystari originals;Worker Placement;Ystari Games,Brain Games,Edge Entertainment,Esdevium,hobbity.eu,Hobby Japan,HUCH! & friends,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,Lautapelit.fi,Quined White Goblin Games,Rio Grande Games,uplay.it edizioni,What's Your Game?,White Goblin Games;7.86152;21806;caylus;19;0.0;0.0;3.666477328855084;0;-1.58;CFFV7Sik8v;False;0;5.0;150.0;12.0;2.0;60.0;Caylus;191;2-5;567;60-150;141.99;72.95;0.0;0.0;1152;2005.0;caylus

Bright summer days filled with games of tag and attempts to flock closer to Roger, the Heartthrob Ram? But, Watch Out! The shearer wants to drag you away from all the fun and games!&#10;&#10;In Shear Panic, ewe maneuver your ewes to score points, playing tag, standing close to Roger, or trying to avoid the shearing scissors! Will your brave sheep score the most points, or will it be &quot;Off with the wool&quot; for ewe?&quot;&#10;&#10;The game includes eleven small figurines (which are somewhat fragile): Two each of four different colors, one black, one 'Roger', and one 'Shearer'. Also included are four player mats in different colors; a timing/scoring mat; 48 mutton buttons in four colors; four scoring markers; one flock marker; and two special six-sided dice.&#10;&#10;There are two separate play areas: The one where the flock of sheep figurines are clustered; and the combination timing/scoring mat. (The timing mat is two-sided for 3 or 4 players.) Actions by the players each turn cause the timing marker to move faster or slower through each of the four fields, and the scoring is different in each field.&#10;&#10;Field 1 is Team Tag. Players score higher for keeping their sheep closer together. Field 2 is Roger&rsquo;s Field, where players score more the closer they are to Roger (the ram). Field 3 is Black Sheep Tag, and players score higher the closer they are to the black sheep. Field 4 is the Shear Panic Field, and the row of sheep closest to the shearer figure are eliminated each turn, while the remainder are scored individually. The timing marker indicates which Field the sheep are currently &ldquo;in&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Players have a total of twelve actions they may take during the course of the game, and as each one is used, a &ldquo;mutton button&rdquo; is placed over it, eliminating it from future use. Also, the more powerful the action, the farther (faster) the timing marker will move. If the timing marker lands on a red spot, the active player executes a free &ldquo;lamb slam&rdquo; by rolling the Panic Die and moving a sheep of the color rolled one space in any direction. If the Panic Die rolls white, the entire flock does a &ldquo;ewe turn&rdquo; ninety degrees in a direction of the active player&rsquo;s choice.&#10;&#10;Since all the player mats are visible to everyone, players need to keep an eye on what moves are still available to their opponents.&#10;&#10;The game is intended for three or four players, but rules for a two-player variant are included.&#10;&#10;Starting player is the person who most recently was sheared (had their hair cut).&#10;&#10;";4;45;10;2;45;Shear Panic;45;2005;Paolo Chiari,Gabriela Silveira;Animals;Gordon Lamont,Fraser Lamont;Animals: Sheep;Dice Rolling,Grid Movement,Hand Management,Pattern Building;999 Games,Egmont Polska,Fragor Games,Mayfair Games,Raven Distribution,Zoch Verlag;6.4006300000000005;3367;shear panic;75;0.0;0.0;3.2;0;0.0;GS1kuvr0Te;False;0;4.0;45.0;10.0;2.0;45.0;Shear Panic;25;2-4;77;45;30.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;360;2005.0;shear panic

Reporting directly to Nero, you are responsible for rebuilding the structures lost in the fire and restoring Glory to Rome.&#10;&#10;Glory to Rome is a card-based city building and resource management game with a novel mechanism. Each card may act as a building, a client, a raw material, or a valuable resource, frequently forcing players into difficult decisions regarding how each card should be used. In addition, much of the game is played from the discard pool, giving players some control over what cards are accessible to opponents.  Actions are triggered by a form of card-driven role selection -- the active player leader a role, and other players may follow if they discard a matching card from hand (to the pool).  Players who don't follow may 'think' to draw more cards.  There are thus strong interactions between the different uses of cards.  Scoring is a combination of completing buildings and storing resources, with end-of-game bonuses for storing a diverse assortment. Game length is player-controlled, and is triggered in a few different ways.&#10;&#10;The lighthearted artwork of the original editions was replaced by minimalist art in the 'black box' edition, and both have been the source of great controversy.

Meanwhile, the animals are gathering before the ark and waiting to be told who goes in which stalls. A handful of people have showed up to offer help, but they look like gamblers and game players!&#10;&#10;In Ark, the players need to help load animals and supplies into Noah's ark in preparation for the rains to come &ndash; but you can't just shove animals into stalls willy-nilly. If the meat eaters are boarded with plant eaters, you won't have those plant eaters around by the time the water recedes. Animals from cold and warm climates also need to be bunked separately so that they can all be comfortable. On top of all that, you have to worry about the weight of the animals; load too many on one side of the ark and you'll all be treading water for the next forty days and forty nights...&#10;&#10;The game consists of cards, animal tokens, and &quot;action&quot; discs.  Your goal is to place your animal tokens (as victory points) based on characteristics of the animal and provision cards loaded on the &quot;ark&quot;.  Each player takes turns either placing cards or drawing cards from a face-up draft pile (Card Drafting) and the supply stack.  Each card has characteristics (such as the animal size, diet, climate, scoring category, and special ability).  Animals and provisions must be placed according to rules that prevent animals from eating each other, eating the supplies, or tipping the &quot;ark&quot; with their combined weight.  When a card is played, the player may place a &quot;victory point&quot; animal token on one of the 5 scoring category cards.  In this way, the game combines Tile Placement of the cards with Set Collection for types of victory points.  The game ends when a fifth &quot;Rain Card&quot;, somewhat randomly shuffled into the deck, is drawn.  Players then score points for their animal tokens, and bonus points for having the most or second most tokens per category.&#10;&#10;";5;45;8;3;45;Ark;45;2005;Doris Matthäus;Animals,Religious;Doris Matthäus,Frank Nestel;;Card Drafting,Set Collection,Tile Placement;Doris & Frank,PS-Games,Rio Grande Games,Wargames Club Publishing;6.29879;1307;ark;99;0.0;0.0;3.5;0;0.0;lI53f1tXll;False;0;5.0;45.0;8.0;3.0;45.0;Ark;1;3-5;0;45;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;27;2005.0;ark

The end of each of the five rounds is also marked by a highly variable fight to claim the best sleeping spaces on board the ship (bed or board?). The game is a mixture of tactics, strategy, and luck. The die plays an important role in the game, but you still get the feeling of being at the mercy of fate only rarely.&#10;&#10;The game contains 76 plastic pirate figures, 9 game board pieces that ensure the board is always different, about 200 tiles, and 1 die.&#10;&#10;Description adapted from the Gamewire Essen Preview.&#10;&#10;This game is #10 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;";5;60;9;2;60;Rum & Pirates;60;2006;Claus Stephan;Dice,Miniatures,Pirates;Stefan Feld;Alea Big Box;Action Point Allowance System,Dice Rolling,Modular Board;alea,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH,Rio Grande Games;6.43205;1581;rum & pirates;52;0.0;0.0;2.7857142857142856;0;0.0;jwPqvs7V7E;False;0;5.0;60.0;9.0;2.0;60.0;Rum & Pirates;14;2-5;35;60;287.04;0.0;0.0;0.0;90;2006.0;rum & pirates

Put your dollars on the line . . . it's time to roll!&#10;&#10;The game board is broken into 8 different areas, each consisting of a number of empty 'lots'. Players build lots by paying money and placing a die of the value matching the one shown on the lot's space onto the lot, along with a casino tile of one of 7 colors. Adjoining lots of the same color are considered a single casino. The casino's boss is the player whose die value is higher than any other in the casino. On each players turn, players turn over a new card representing a new lot they get. The card also is one of the casino colors. Any built casinos of the matching color will score both money and VP. Money is earned for each lot in the casino, where each lot may be owned by a different player. VP goes only to the casino's owner. Players can expand their casinos; try to take over casinos owned by other players; make deals to trade lots, casinos and money; or gamble in opponents' casinos to make more money.

355;4639;21050;"Combat Commander: Europe is a card-driven board game covering tactical infantry combat in the European Theater of World War II. One player takes the role of the Axis (Germany) while another player commands the Allies (America or Russia). These two players will take turns playing one or more &ldquo;Fate&rdquo; cards from their hands in order to activate his units on the mapboard for various military functions.&#10;&#10;Players attempt to achieve victory by moving their combat units across the game map to attack their opponent&rsquo;s combat units and occupy as many objectives as possible. The degree to which a player succeeds or fails is measured by a scenario&rsquo;s specific &ldquo;Objective&rdquo; chits, the destruction of enemy units, and the exiting of friendly units off the opponent&rsquo;s board edge.&#10;&#10;A game of Combat Commander is divided into several measures of Game Time. There is no sequence of play to follow, however: each Time segment is divided into a variable number of Player Turns, each of which may consist of one or more Fate Card &quot;Orders&quot; conducted by the active player. Fate Card &quot;Actions&quot; may generally be conducted by either player at any time. &quot;Events&quot; &mdash; both good and bad &mdash; will occur at random intervals to add a bit of chaos and uncertainty to each player&rsquo;s perfect plan.&#10;&#10;SCALE: Each hex of a Combat Commander map is roughly 100 feet of distance (about 30 meters). Each complete Player Phase abstractly represents several seconds of real time.

The board, illustrated by Franz Vohwinkel as well as many well-known American fantasy artists, consists of 21 large building tiles, which show building plans on one side and the buildings in their reconstructed glory on the other.

Whenever a building is completely rebuilt, its tile is turned back over to its rebuilt side. The players who helped with a building get crystals and dragon favors, which can be traded in for crystals at certain times.&#10;&#10;The player who first manages to add the required number of markers by paying crystals to the Obelisk wins the game.

361;4756;22378;"(from Compass Games website):&#10;&#10;Red Storm Over the Reich is a Ted Raicer game covering the epic final campaigns of WWII on the Eastern Front, as the forces of the Soviet Union smashed the German armies defending Poland, East Prussia, and Pomerania, and advanced across the Oder to Berlin. Included in the game are three scenarios.&#10;&#10;The first scenario is historical, which finds the German forces out of position. Their armies will likely be shattered on the first turn, but the victory conditions are tough on the Soviets&ndash; they must do at least as well as historically.&#10;&#10;Scenario two has the historic forces, but allows the Germans to implement Operation Sleigh-ride, a sane pull-back of the main defense line along the Vistula out of range of the opening Russian barrage (an operation historically nixed by Hitler) that at least allows for a more orderly flight.&#10;&#10;Scenario three combines Sleigh-ride with reinforcements from other fronts. It assumes that Hitler has had an incapacitating stroke in late November or early December, and the new Nazi leadership is sufficiently uncertain of its position that it defers in military matters to Guderian. The Ardennes Offensive is cancelled, as are the attempts to relieve Budapest, as well as substantial forces are evacuated from the Courland pocket. This increases German strength on the main eastern front by approximately 50% and doubles German tank strength, which, when combined with Sleigh-ride gives the Germans some serious fighting strength.&#10; Scenarios one and two can be completed in 8-12 hours and scenario three in 12-16 hours, depending on your individual playing style.&#10;&#10;Red Storm is the opposite of 1941 East Front Games: The Soviets have assembled a massive force and will rip gaping holes in the German lines through blitzkrieg-style attacks. The German player must somehow piece together a desperate defense only to have it repeatedly blown apart by the enemy. But time is the enemy of both players in this game. The Soviets need to accomplish their victory by the end of the last turn, satisfying the historical timeline, or they lose the game, and the Germans must delay the Soviet assault on Berlin long enough to prevent the Soviet win.&#10;&#10;The rules for Red Storm Over the Reich are moderate in complexity but feature enough chrome for both sides to recreate this desperate campaign. Special rules include: the creation of Kampfgruppe divisions (or not), naval evacuations, panzerfausts, Volksturm divisions, Leaders, Soviet Logistical Constraint, Hitler mandated attacks and more!&#10;&#10;Included with each game are two maps each 22&rdquo; by 34&rdquo;, two sheets of counters (456 total), rules, set-up charts, tables, dice and game box.&#10;&#10;";2;480;12;2;480;Red Storm over the Reich;480;2007;Todd Davis;Dice,Fighting,Wargame,World War II;Ted Raicer;Country: Germany;Action Point Allowance System,Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Simulation,Variable Player Powers;Compass Games;7.284489999999999;99;red storm over the reich;78;0.0;0.0;3.5;0;0.0;NFeNZJ78Gv;False;0;2.0;480.0;12.0;2.0;480.0;Red Storm over the Reich;1;2;0;480;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;53;2007.0;red storm over the reich

367;4820;23094;"Welcome, dear Imperialists. It's the year 2415. The interplanetary federation (IPF) has done a great job in the last centuries. All necessary precautions have been taken to conquer this planet named &quot;Steam&quot;. The core of the planet consists of a 6,500&ordm; Celsius hot source containing different resources, including water. It has taken over one hundred years to complete the first block of 42 shafts from the surface to the core.&#10;&#10;But now the time has come. From every shaft surges the hot steam that is the basis of the production of raw materials. To be able to use and process this steam, platforms have to be placed over the shafts. Later, we can use the platforms to connect the water purification tanks. By using several tank extractors, we can harvest other resources like energy, ore, and quartz from the steam. These resources are important. You will need them to grow your steam empires. You will need to increase the capacity of your landing craft to transport your harvested materials off planet. Buy and sell the resources at the Trading terminal for profit, as currency is &ndash; like on earth &ndash; always in short supply on Steam. To help you in your endeavours, the IPF has placed several specialists at your command &ndash; but getting the specialist that you require may not be easy.&#10;&#10;Planet Steam is a board game in which two to five players take the roles of entrepreneurs in a steampunk boomtown, racing to assemble equipment, claim plots of land, extract resources, and accumulate riches. After harvesting resources using tanks and converters, players must buy and sell those resources in a volatile and ever-shifting market. The one who earns the most income will, in the end, be victorious. However, only through shrewd resource management and clever manipulation of supply and demand can a player reign supreme!&#10;&#10;";5;120;14;2;120;Planet Steam;120;2008;Czarnè;Economic,Science Fiction;Heinz-Georg Thiemann;Mars,Steampunk;Auction/Bidding,Commodity Speculation,Trading;Edge Entertainment,Fantasy Flight Games,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,LudoArt Verlag;7.27235;2175;planet steam;48;0.0;0.0;3.3629687499999994;0;0.2;EavWwKUti5;False;0;5.0;180.0;14.0;2.0;90.0;Planet Steam;32;2-5;72;90-180;47.95;0.0;66.99;0.0;332;2008.0;planet steam

This game puts you in the driver's seat of the British/Russian alliance or the Ottoman Empire during World War One. Gallipoli, holy war, mutiny, and the Russian Revolution await. Walk in the shoes of men such as Churchill, Lawrence of Arabia, Enver, and Falkenhayn.&#10;&#10;The action stretches from India to the Balkans, from the Black Sea to Suez. Can the Germans inspire a Persian uprising or forge an alliance with Afghanistan? Can the Russians capture a warm water port? Can the British guard the oil that fuels the Royal Navy? Can the Turks capture the Suez Canal and spark a revolt in Egypt?&#10;&#10;In Pursuit of Glory you will constantly feel that you're on the razor's edge - on the verge of impending doom or of breakthrough and total victory. Your hand of 7 cards presents you with a rich array of strategic and operational opportunities. You must decide whether to use each card for its historic event, command points, or resources. You must then commit your forces to a variety of objectives: the Turkish-Russian frontier in Caucasia, the violation of neutral Persia, oil-rich Mesopotamia, the Suez Canal, the Balkans and its vital railroads. You must judge when it is right to invade Serbia or launch a new naval invasion (perhaps on the inset map representing Gallipoli).&#10;&#10;As the British, you must hold on while your Russian allies break through the Turkish lines in Caucasia and you bring your forces to bear through invasion and a gradual build-up of imperial might. As the Turks, your objective is to gain complete victory early, uniting your strength with Germany and crippling the British Empire in Egypt and India or to persevere.&#10;&#10;If you are looking for a game that is relevant, dynamic, fun, tense, and a frantic roller coaster of a game, you will enjoy Pursuit of Glory.&#10;&#10;Game Features&#10;TIME SCALE    Approx. 1 year per hand of cards&#10;MAP SCALE    Point-to-Point&#10;NUMBER OF PLAYERS    One or Two&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10;Two full color counter sheets&#10;110 full color playing cards&#10;One 22 x 34&quot; full color map&#10;Rule Booklet&#10;Scenario Booklet&#10;Player Aid Cards&#10;Two 6-sided dice&#10;&#10;DESIGNER: Brad Stock &amp; Brian Stock&#10;DEVELOPER: Tony Curtis &amp; Neil Randall&#10;MAP, CARD, &amp; COUNTER ART: Mark Simonitch&#10;&#10;&#10;(BGG description:)&#10;&#10;Pursuit of Glory is a stand alone sequel to Paths of Glory, a card-driven strategy game covering the first World War.

377;4923;24181;"From the rulebook:&#10;&#10;Europe in the age of imperialism. International investors try to achieve the greatest influence in Europe. With their bonds, they control the politics of the six imperial nations: Austria-Hungary, Italy, France, Great Britain, the German Empire, and Russia. The nations erect factories, build fleets, and deploy armies. The investors watch as their nations expand, wage wars, levy taxes, and collect the proceeds. Since the European nations are under the shifting influence of different investors, new strategic alliances and conflicts arise between them again and again!&#10;&#10;Each player represents an international investor. Only he who succeeds in increasing his capital and gaining influence in the most powerful European nations will win the imperial competition.&#10;&#10;Imperial is a varied strategy game without the luck of dice or cards.

380;4950;24508;"In Taluva, players attempt to successfully settle a South Sea island slowly emerging from the ocean waters as volcano after volcano erupts.&#10;&#10;Each turn, players decide to either have a new volcano erupt along the shore, increasing the size of the island, or to have an existing volcano erupt again, increasing the height of the land around it (and possibly destroying parts of existing settlements). They do this by placing a new tile, consisting of one volcano and two other types of landscape. A tile must always touch at least one other tile, when placed at sea level, or be placed on top of at least two other tiles (without any gaps under the land being created), with the volcano being placed on top of an existing volcano.&#10;Next, the player will place one or more wooden buildings; huts, temples or towers. Settlements must always start at the lowest level, by placing a single hut. From there on, existing settlements may expand by placing huts on all hexes of a single type of terrain around the settlement, with temples once the settlement takes up at least three hexes, or with towers, placed at level three or above.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all tiles have been placed. At that point, the player who's placed most temples wins. Ties are broken by towers, then huts. Ultimate victory - and an immediate end to the game - waits for the player who manages to place all their buildings of two types. Immediate defeat is also possible, when no buildings can legally be played during a player's turn.&#10;&#10;A lot of strategy results from the various placement rules. Volcanoes may never fully destroy a settlement, so single huts can block volcano placement, protecting other settlements. Alternatively, a well placed volcano can split a large settlement in two, creating the opportunity for both to expand more rapidly than a new settlement would. Limiting your opponent's growth potential is at least as important as preparing the terrain for you to expand upon...&#10;&#10;";4;45;8;2;45;Taluva;45;2006;Manuel Casasola Merkle,Xavier Gueniffey Durin,Julien Le Faucheur,Marcel-André Casasola Merkle;City Building,Territory Building;Marcel-André Casasola Merkle;3D Games,Oceanian Theme,Tropical theme;Modular Board,Tile Placement;Cranio Creations,Ferti,Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH,Rio Grande Games;7.18932;6033;taluva;44;0.0;0.0;3.5992647058823533;0;0.38;Y0HGxGFjcT;False;0;4.0;60.0;8.0;2.0;45.0;Taluva;68;2-4;378;45-60;36.95;0.0;70.19;0.0;606;2006.0;taluva

Seek your fortune through trade, rumor hunting, missions, and of course, plundering.  Modify your ship, buy impressive vessels, load deadly special ammunition, and hire specialist crew members. Will your captain gain eternal glory and immense wealth - or find his wet grave under the stormy surface of the Caribbean Sea?&#10;&#10;In Merchants and Marauders, players take on the role of a captain of a small vessel in the Caribbean.  The goal is to be the first to achieve 10 &quot;glory&quot; points through performing daring deeds (through the completion of missions or rumors), crushing your enemies (through defeating opponents and NPCs in combat), amassing gold, performing an epic plunder or pulling off the trade of a lifetime, and buying a grand ship.  While some points earned from performing various tasks are permanent, players earn points for amassing gold, which can be stolen or lost (or at least diminished) if their captain is killed.  Points due to gold are hidden so there's some uncertainty about when the game will end.&#10;&#10;A big component of the game is whether (or when) to turn &quot;pirate&quot; or remain as a trader or neutral party. Both careers are fraught with danger: pirates are hunted by NPCs (and other players) for their bounty and blocked to certain ports while traders are hunted by non-player pirates as well as their opponents and generally have to sacrifice combat capability for cargo capacity.  Although players can kill each other, there is no player elimination as players may draw a new captain (with a penalty) so it's possible to come back from defeat.&#10;&#10;";4;180;13;2;180;Merchants & Marauders;180;2010;Ben Nelson,Chris Quilliams;Adventure,Nautical,Pirates,Transportation;Kasper Aagaard,Christian Marcussen;Colonial Theme,Country: Costa Rica,Tropical theme;Action Point Allowance System,Area Movement,Dice Rolling,Pick-up and Deliver,Variable Player Powers;Asmodee,Asterion Press,Conclave Editora,Filosofia Éditions,Pegasus Spiele,REBEL.pl,White Goblin Games,Z-Man Games;7.451010000000001;9596;merchants & marauders;40;0.0;0.0;3.453842592592593;0;0.0;fd7jnoSPM6;False;0;4.0;180.0;13.0;2.0;180.0;Merchants & Marauders;108;2-4;279;180;0.0;85.0;59.99;51.95;1808;2010.0;merchants & marauders

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;";4;240;12;2;240;Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization;240;2006;Richard Cortes,Paul Niemeyer;City Building,Civilization,Economic;Vlaada Chvátil;Tableau Building;Action Point Allowance System,Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Hand Management;Czech Board Games,Czech Games Edition,DiceTree Games,Eagle-Gryphon Games,HomoLudicus,IELLO,MINDOK,Pegasus Spiele,Portal Games,Raven Distribution,REBEL.pl,Wargames Club Publishing;8.09024;15337;through the ages: a story of civilization;22;0.0;0.0;3.7529499999999993;0;0.43;qqsqAXXFmJ;False;0;4.0;240.0;12.0;2.0;240.0;Through the Ages: A Story of Civilization;100;2-4;405;240;39.95;0.0;51.95;0.0;511;2006.0;through the ages: a story of civilization

393;5151;27364;"The general theme and mechanics of Caylus Magna Carta are similar to the Caylus board game. However, there is no board or score track and the tactical nuts and bolts of the game are somewhat different. In terms of components, the game consists of cards, money, worker pawns, resource markers, the provost, and castle building stones. Each player has a set of identical cards, which are shuffled and used as a face-down draw deck. Players start with an opening random draw of cards, and on his turn a player can either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    extend the road by building a new building &#10;    pay 1 to draw a new building card &#10;    pay 1 to discard his hand and draw a fresh hand (with the discard deck being shuffled for a new draw deck once the draw deck is exhausted) &#10;    pay 1 to place a worker on one of the existing building cards &#10;    build one of the common prestige building cards (some of which are placed at the beginning of the game as part of the setup) or &#10;    pass&#10;&#10;&#10;Once everyone has passed, the cards are resolved up to the provost (which can be moved in passing order by paying money).&#10;&#10;Ownership of the non-common buildings is shown by the card color. When a worker is placed on a card, the owner earns either resources or money as a reward instead of victory points. Players may also choose to help build the castle. Starting with the first player to have passed, players can pay resources to obtain castle stones. The stones are worth three different values (2-4 points). Players collect the most valuable ones first. In addition, the player who collects the most building stones each round is rewarded with a gold resource marker.&#10;&#10;From round to round, 1st player privileges rotate to the left, and the provost starts two cards further down the path from the castle.&#10;&#10;The winner of the game is the player who has accumulated the most victory points once the game end has been triggered the turn the castle is finished. Victory points are awarded for castle stones, cards built, and resources and money in hand at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";4;75;10;2;45;Caylus Magna Carta;75;2007;Arnaud Demaegd;Card Game,City Building,Economic,Medieval;William Attia;Caylus,Ystari originals;Hand Management,Worker Placement;Esdevium,HUCH! & friends,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,Lautapelit.fi,Quined White Goblin Games,Rio Grande Games,Ystari Games;6.97283;4404;caylus magna carta;53;0.0;0.0;3.1032608695652177;0;0.0;KihYNNM5NS;False;0;4.0;75.0;10.0;2.0;45.0;Caylus Magna Carta;46;2-4;68;45-75;39.95;0.0;0.0;0.0;378;2007.0;caylus magna carta

395;5177;27708;"From the author:&#10;&#10;&quot;Sometimes the history of a nation can be defined by the relationship between two individuals. The Election of 1960 is the story of two men, John F. Kennedy and Richard M. Nixon. One is the scion of a wealthy, politically powerful family from New England. The other is the son of a Quaker grocer in Whittier, California. While they belong to opposing political parties, they start out as friends. The complex development of that friendship, however, would shape a pivotal presidential election and cast a long shadow over American history for the remainder of the 20th century.&#10;&#10;&quot;In 1960: The Making of the President, you take on the role of one of these great protagonists vying for the right to lead his country into the heart of the Cold War. However, it is not just foreign policy that poses a challenge to American leadership; this is also an era of great social turmoil and progress. As the United States continues to build upon the promise of its founding, candidates must contend with the question of civil rights and balance their positions on social justice against the need for valuable Southern electoral votes. Of course, the ever-present issue of the economy also rears its ugly head, and both Nixon and Kennedy will compete to be the candidate with the voters' pocket books in mind.&#10;&#10;&quot;The contest is fought out on an electoral map of the United States as it stood in 1960&mdash;a map where Louisiana and Florida share the same number of electoral votes, as do California and Pennsylvania. Using a card-driven game system, all the major events which shaped the campaign are represented: Nixon&rsquo;s lazy shave, President Eisenhower&rsquo;s late endorsement, and the 'Catholic question' are all included as specific event cards. The famous televised debates and final election day push are each handled with their own subsystems. Candidates vie to capture each state&rsquo;s electoral votes using campaign points in the four different regions of the country. At the same time, they must build momentum by dominating the issues of the day and attempt to gain control of the airwaves.&#10;&#10;&quot;As with any election campaign, the challenge is to adapt your game plan as the ground shifts out from under you. There are never enough resources or time to do everything, but you need to make the tough calls to propel yourself into the White House. This fast-playing strategy game for two players challenges you to run for the most powerful elective office in the world, at one of its most unique crossroads. Will you recreate history, or rewrite it? 1960: The Making of the President provides you the opportunity to do both.&quot;&#10;&#10;";2;90;12;2;90;1960: The Making of the President;90;2007;Josh Cappel;Political;Christian Leonhard,Jason Matthews;Country: USA,Political: Elections;Area Control / Area Influence,Campaign / Battle Card Driven,Hand Management;Filosofia Éditions,Gabinete Lúdico,GMT Games,Z-Man Games;7.5628600000000015;6956;1960: the making of the president;0;0.0;0.0;3.766666666666669;0;0.33;uz3TSM7DxK;False;0;2.0;120.0;12.0;2.0;90.0;1960: The Making of the President;80;2;215;90-120;59.99;134.99;84.95;67.58;1119;2007.0;1960: the making of the president

This time, there is no board on which to place little figures: Every player has his own score card called the building sheet, which depicts a mini Catan (compare with Die Siedler von Catan: Paper & Pencil). You build by drawing the settlements and roads on your score card.&#10;&#10;To build you still require resources. These are collected by a Yahtzee-like mechanism that involves throwing six special dice (depicting the different resource symbols) up to three times. After each roll, the player can select which dice to keep and which to roll again. In the end, he may build using the thusly determined resources, and is awarded victory points for any finished buildings, which are recorded on the score card.&#10;&#10;The game lasts fifteen turns or about 15-30 minutes, after which the player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;Note that the game has been designed for 1-4 players, meaning there is a solitaire version of the game, as well.&#10;&#10;Recent versions include double-sided map sheets and instructions for Catan Dice Game Plus.&#10;&#10;";4;15;7;1;15;Catan Dice Game;15;2007;Volkan Baga,Tanja Donner,Michaela Kienle,Harald Lieske,Michael Menzel;Dice;Klaus Teuber;Catan;Dice Rolling,Paper-and-Pencil,Set Collection;999 Games,Albi,Devir,Galakta,Hobby World,Kaissa Chess & Games,KOSMOS,Laser plus,Mayfair Games,Piatnik,Smart Ltd,Stupor Mundi;5.6732;3623;catan dice game;81;2.5;1.5;2.6650000000000005;0;0.34;gnv8PYIV3A;False;0;4.0;15.0;7.0;1.0;15.0;Catan Dice Game;50;1-4;243;15;8.54;19.95;15.95;10.33;357;2007.0;catan dice game

402;5213;28023;"Summary: This is a pirate-themed tactical race game with player interaction and side goals (e.g. detouring for treasure).  The winner is the player who best balances their position in the race with their success at the side goals.&#10;&#10;Setting: Jamaica, 1675.&#10;After a long career in piracy, Captain Henry Morgan skillfully gets appointed to be Governor of Jamaica, with the explicit order to cleanse the Caribbean of pirates and buccaneers! Instead, he invites all of his former &quot;colleagues&quot; to join him in his retirement, to enjoy the fruits of their looting with impunity. Each year, in remembrance  of the &quot;good old days,&quot; Morgan organizes the Great Challenge, a race around the island, and at its end, the Captain with the most gold is declared Grand Winner.&#10;&#10;Goal: The game ends on the turn when at least one player's ship reaches the finish line, completing one circuit around the island of Jamaica. At that point, players are awarded different amounts of gold in accordance with how far away from the finish line they were when the race concluded. This gold is added to any gold a player gathered along the way by detouring from the race to search for valuable treasure, by stealing gold or treasure from other players, or just by loading gold as directed by the cards the player played during the race. The player with the most total gold acquired through all these means is then declared the winner.&#10;&#10;Gameplay: The game is played in rounds. Each player always has a hand of three cards, and a personal board depicting the five &quot;holds&quot; of their ship, into which goods can be loaded during the game. Each round, one player is designated as &quot;captain,&quot; with the next clockwise player being captain in the following round, and so on. The captain rolls two standard D6 dice, examines her cards, then announces which die will correspond to the &quot;day&quot; and which to the &quot;night.&quot; Each player then simultaneously selects a card from their hand and places it face down in front of them. Each card has two symbols on it, one on the left - corresponding to &quot;day&quot; - and one on the right (&quot;night&quot;). The symbols indicate either ship movement (forward or backward) or the loading of a type of good. After every player has selected a card, all cards are revealed simultaneously and then resolved clockwise one by one, starting with the captain's. When it is a player's turn to resolve her card, for first the left symbol on her card and then for the right symbol, the player will load a number of goods or move a number of spaces equal to the number of pips showing on the corresponding day or night die for that round. Thus the main decision each player makes during the game is which of their current three cards would best serve them on a particular turn, given the values of the day and night dice.  Finally, during the race, when a player lands on a spot already occupied by another player, there is a battle. Battles are mainly resolved by rolling a &quot;combat&quot; die, but players may improve their chances by using &quot;gunpowder&quot; tokens from their holds, if they loaded any on previous turns. The winner of a battle may steal some goods or treasure from the loser.&#10;&#10;";6;60;8;2;30;Jamaica;60;2007;Mathieu Leyssenne;Nautical,Pirates,Racing,Transportation;Malcolm Braff,Bruno Cathala,Sébastien Pauchon;Colonial Theme,Country: Jamaica,Tropical theme;Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Simultaneous Action Selection;Asmodee,Asterion Press,GameWorks SàRL,REBEL.pl;7.09862;10323;jamaica;2;2.0;2.0;3.409963719040248;0;0.4;i2Z60mRM0G;False;11;6.0;60.0;8.0;2.0;30.0;Jamaica;224;2-6;1023;30-60;35.99;72.0;52.99;29.08;3078;2007.0;jamaica

Fourteen disks are laid out at the start of the game, each showing one or more countries and the symbols required to conquer these countries, with the symbols being separated into battle lines. Each card belongs to a continent, with some continents having only a single card and some having up to four cards.&#10;&#10;A player starts his turn by rolling seven dice, the six sides of which show artillery, cavalry, general, and 1-3 infantry. He then selects a card and uses the symbols rolled to conquer exactly one of the battle lines on this card (by placing the appropriate dice on that line). If he can do this, he then rolls the remaining dice, ideally conquering another line; if he can't conquer a line, he removes one die from play, then rolls again. His turn ends when either he conquers every line on the card (in which case he claims it) or he no longer has dice available to roll.&#10;&#10;Each card is worth a number of victory points. You can conquer cards owned by other players, but you need to conquer an additional general line in the process. If a player owns all the cards of one continent, however, those cards are secure and cannot be stolen. What's more, these cards are now worth more points because you've united the continent under one ruler (you).&#10;&#10;When the last card is claimed, players tally their points, and whoever has the highest score wins.&#10;&#10;";6;20;8;2;20;Risk Express;20;2006;;Dice,Territory Building,Wargame;Reiner Knizia;Hasbro Express Line,Risk;Dice Rolling;Hasbro,Parker Brothers,Parker Spiele;6.27464;901;risk express;58;0.0;0.0;3.2222222222222223;0;0.0;MStZuWI6C3;False;0;6.0;20.0;8.0;2.0;20.0;Risk Express;9;2-6;65;20;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;141;2006.0;risk express

406;5260;28720;"Brass: Lancashire &mdash; first published as Brass &mdash; is an economic strategy game that tells the story of competing cotton entrepreneurs in Lancashire during the industrial revolution. You must develop, build, and establish your industries and network so that you can capitalize demand for iron, coal and cotton. The game is played over two halves: the canal phase and the rail phase. To win the game, score the most victory points (VPs), which are counted at the end of each half. VPs are gained from your canals, rails, and established (flipped) industry tiles. Each round, players take turns according to the turn order track, receiving two actions to perform any of the following:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Build an industry tile&#10;    Build a rail or canal&#10;    Develop an industry&#10;    Sell cotton&#10;    Take a loan&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a player's turn, they replace the two cards they played with two more from the deck. Turn order is determined by how much money a player spent on the previous turn, from lowest spent first to highest spent. This turn order mechanism opens some strategic options for players going later in the turn order, allowing for the possibility of back-to-back turns.&#10;&#10;After all the cards have been played the first time (with the deck size being adjusted for the number of players), the canal phase ends and a scoring round commences. After scoring, all canals and all of the lowest level industries are removed for the game, after which new cards are dealt and the rail phase begins. During this phase, players may now occupy more than one location in a city and a double-connection build (though expensive) is possible. At the end of the rail phase, another scoring round takes place, then a winner is crowned.&#10;&#10;The cards limit where you can build your industries, but any card can be used for the develop, sell cotton or build connections actions. This leads to a strategic timing/storing of cards. Resources are common so that if one player builds a rail line (which requires coal) they have to use the coal from the nearest source, which may be an opponent's coal mine, which in turn gets that coal mine closer to scoring (i.e., being utilized).&#10;&#10;Brass: Lancashire, the 2018 edition from Roxley Games, reboots the original Warfrog Games edition of Brass with new artwork and components, as well as a few rules changes:&#10;&#10;&#10;     The virtual link rules between Birkenhead have been removed.&#10;     The three-player experience has been brought closer to the ideal experience of four players by shortening each half of the game by one round and tuning the deck slightly to ensure a consistent experience.&#10;     Two-player rules have been created and are playable without the need for an alternate board.&#10;     The level 1 cotton mill is now worth 5 VP to make it slightly less terrible.&#10;&#10;&#10;";4;180;14;2;120;Brass: Lancashire;180;2007;Lina Cossette,Peter Dennis,David Forest,Eckhard Freytag,Damien Mammoliti;Economic,Industry / Manufacturing,Transportation;Martin Wallace;Cities: Manchester,Country: England;Hand Management,Route/Network Building;Roxley,Warfrog Games,Eagle-Gryphon Games,FRED Distribution, Inc.,Pegasus Spiele,Wargames Club Publishing,White Goblin Games;8.00918;10659;brass: lancashire;30;3.0;4.0;3.979854368932041;0;0.31;sXuOW0UGlh;False;9;4.0;180.0;14.0;2.0;120.0;Brass: Lancashire;206;2-4;1207;120-180;47.99;90.0;64.95;55.66;2421;2007.0;brass: lancashire

Seize power sources and capitals, develop your infrastructure, and build and wield vast, high-tech armies in your bid for global domination.&#10;&#10;Players will probably recognize the map as that of Earth, but what they will not see are any borders or nations. In the world of Dust, the unending war and the new technologies have altered the political face of Earth beyond all recognition.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of each turn, players select a card from their hand. This card represents their strategy for the coming turn and to a large extent dictates the actions a player can take.&#10;&#10;During their production phase, players spend production points to buy additional factories and units. Each individual unit type has its own unique statistics and effects, so players have to carefully consider the composition of their armies.&#10;&#10;In combat, players alternate rolling dice and destroying units until one side has been eliminated (either due to casualties or retreats) or a cease-fire is declared.&#10;&#10;At the end of each game round, players score victory points for power sources, capitals, and majorities they control. The player who controls the most land areas earns bonus victory points, as does the player who controls the most sea areas and the player who controls the most production centers. The first player to amass a set number of victory points while also controlling a capital is the winner.&#10;&#10;Only once a player has amassed at least half the victory points required to win can he or she attack an enemy capital.

411;5305;29383;"GD &rsquo;42: The Battle in the Luchessa Valley, 29 November - 4 December, 1942, covers the desperate battle for survival of the GD Division as it faced down the entire Soviet 3rd Mech Corps (with over 200 tanks) over several days. 25 November, 1942: As part of Operation Mars, the Soviet 238th Rifle Division, supported by tanks of the 49th Tank Brigade, attacked into the Luchessa Valley, trying to create a breach for the waiting 3rd Mech Corps to exploit. For reasons still unknown, right before the attack the German 9th Army ordered three battalions the GD Division to move to the Luchessa Valley as OKH reserve, thus backing up the weak 216th Grenadier Regiment. Because of the presence of the GD, the Soviets were unable to force a breakthrough and decided to commit the 3rd Mech Corps into the meat grinder to force the issue...&#10;&#10;Designer Wig Graves conducted extensive research, combing both German and Soviet sources to create the order of battle. The Soviets begin with seemingly overwhelming force, while the Germans trade space for time and attempt to rush reinforcements to the front to plug inevitable gaps. While the Germans are primarily on the defense, careful counter-attacks against the relatively immobile Soviet formations can prove to be key to victory. And if the Soviets do not preserve their forces carefully, they will end with the historical result: stable German lines and an entire mechanized corps wrecked.&#10;&#10;GD &rsquo;42 uses the new Tactical Combat Series rules.

The rent for the Casino is pure luck, but sometimes the owner has to pay out to the visitor.  Parks don't garner much rent, and what rent they gather is based on the weather, which can change with every Chance or Community Chest event (the Park's main benefit is its worth in Fortune Tokens at game end:  A Park on Gentle Sands is the equivalent of four million dollars cash at the end of the game).  Piers' rent depends not only on the weather, but also the presence or absence of a cruise ship, which is also affected by the card events.  Finally, Restaurants' rent is dependent upon the neighboring property improvements.  There are very few of these developments, though, so the competition for them can be fierce!&#10;&#10;Although the basic board layout is the same as a standard Monopoly board, there are no Chance and Community Chest cards; when a player lands on one of those two spots, the DVD determines what happens.&#10;&#10;One of the dice has a TV symbol in place of the 1-pip; when the TV is rolled, a News Broadcast is played on the DVD, which triggers a random event (much like Chance or Community Chest).&#10;&#10;Players collect Fortune Tokens (and earn them at the end of the game through their cash and property holdings).

415;5331;29839;"Key Harvest is the fifth game in the key series of games published by R&amp;D Games.&#10;&#10;The object of the game is to score the most points.  Players score points by placing tiles on their own country board.  One point is scored for each field tile in the player's largest group of connected field tiles and two points for each tile in their second largest connected group.&#10;&#10;Points are also scored for the worker tiles a player places on their country board.  The number of points scored for each worker is equal to the number on the worker tile.  Worker tiles do not count as connecting tiles when calculating the largest group of tiles.  When played, a worker enables a player to take a special action.  Each player has their own team of six workers, known as farmhands.  There are also six townsfolk who can be acquired by any player.&#10;&#10;There are usually six field tiles available at any time from the registry.  On their turn a player may bid for up to two tiles using crop counters.  The field tile being bid for and the bid in crop counters are placed in the player's store.  On their turn the other players may match the store owner's bid in both the number and type of crop counters.  If they choose to do so, then they place the field tile on their country board and pay the crop counters to the store owner.  If no other player has matched the store owner's bid, then on their next turn the store owner may place the field tile(s) from their store onto their country board and pay their bid in crop counters to the general stock.&#10;&#10;When deciding how much to bid for a field tile, players will need to consider how important the field tile is to them and whether other players are likely to bid for the tile.  It is usually beneficial for a player to place field tiles into their store as that player will either obtain the field tile or receive additional crop counters.&#10;&#10;When played, a worker tile must be adjacent to at least the number of field tiles as the number on the worker tile.  A worker tile cannot be adjacent to another worker tile.  If a player obtains a field tile for a space where they have already placed a worker tile, they must remove the worker tile.  However, if the worker tile can be replaced immediately (next to the required number of field tiles), then the player can benefit from the worker's ability again.  Getting these extra benefits is one of the keys to doing well in the game.&#10;&#10;Players have two actions per turn.  There are four possible actions.  Each action can only be performed once per turn.  As described above, the actions include placing field tiles from the stores onto their country board - action (c), placing field tiles from the registry into their store - action (d), and placing a worker tile onto their country board - action (b).  Action (c) cannot be performed after action (d).  A player may also harvest crops by turning over some unharvested field tiles on their country board - action (a).&#10;&#10;Field tiles taken from the registry are replaced immediately with field tiles from the bag.  The bag also contains a number of event tiles.  The event tiles, when drawn, affect all of the players, not just the player who drew the event tile.  When the tenth event tile is drawn, the game ends after two further rounds have been played.&#10;&#10;One point is also awarded to the players who have the most of each of the types of crop counters at the end of the game.  No points are awarded for ties.  Points are tallied using the scoring track on the town board.  The player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;Nr. 4 in the QWG Master Print Edition series, as Demetra&#10;&#10;";4;90;10;2;90;Key Harvest;90;2007;Juliet Breese,Mike Doyle (I);Farming,Medieval,Territory Building;Richard Breese;Key-series,Quined Master Print Edition Series;Auction/Bidding,Set Collection,Tile Placement,Worker Placement;ABACUSSPIELE,Quined White Goblin Games,R&D Games,Rio Grande Games;6.81117;1507;key harvest;28;0.0;0.0;3.3571428571428568;0;0.0;BNyS0yrr6T;False;0;4.0;90.0;10.0;2.0;90.0;Key Harvest;28;2-4;69;90;0.0;0.0;39.49;0.0;215;2007.0;key harvest

419;5368;30549;"In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. A second, separate deck of cards controls the &quot;normal&quot; spread of the infections.&#10;&#10;Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead of the normal five&mdash;but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!&#10;&#10;The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters&mdash;the Contingency Planner and the Quarantine Specialist&mdash;not available in earlier editions of the game.&#10;&#10;";4;45;8;2;45;Pandemic;45;2008;Josh Cappel,Christian Hanisch,Régis Moulun,Chris Quilliams,Tom Thiel;Medical;Matt Leacock;Pandemic;Action Point Allowance System,Co-operative Play,Hand Management,Point to Point Movement,Set Collection,Trading,Variable Player Powers;Z-Man Games,(Unknown),Albi,Asterion Press,Brain Games,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Gém Klub Kft.,Hobby Japan,HomoLudicus,Jolly Thinkers,Kaissa Chess & Games,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,Lacerta,Lautapelit.fi,Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd,MINDOK,Nordic Games GmbH,Paladium Games,Pegasus Spiele,Quined White Goblin Games,Stratelibri,Wargames Club Publishing,White Goblin Games,Zhiyanjia,Взрослые дети;7.672339999999998;62377;pandemic;0;2.5;2.4000000000000004;3.6429687779541786;1;0.2;6FmFeux5xH;False;0;4.0;60.0;8.0;2.0;45.0;Pandemic;960;2-4;5512;45-60;35.99;46.0;39.95;31.8;5393;2008.0;pandemic
420;5373;30645;"&quot;The way to have Power is to take it&quot; - William &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed&#10;&#10;Tammany Hall is a game of backstabbing, corruption, temporary alliances, and taking power at all costs. If you want to rule New York, you are going to need to play the city's growing immigrant populations against one another. Help the immigrant groups who owe you political favors, call in those favors to slander your rivals, and win elections.&#10;&#10;In Tammany Hall, players help immigrants settle in New York, collect political favors from those immigrant groups, send ward bosses into Manhattan to secure votes, and slander political opponents. An election is held at the end of every fourth year, and the player who uses his power base best will be elected mayor. The Mayor's grip on the city is tenuous at best. After every election, the Mayor must pay off his political rivals by placing them in offices that they can wield to try to take control of the city. Every player is your friend, every player is your enemy.&#10;&#10;Tammany Hall was the political machine that dominated New York City politics by organizing the immigrant populations. While the organization's influence spanned from its founding in the 1790s to its collapse in the 1960s, this game is set in lower Manhattan roughly between 1850 and 1870 &ndash; the era of Boss Tweed.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;8 page rulebook&#10;1 Game board&#10;5 City Office cards&#10;25 Green Immigrant cubes&#10;25 White Immigrant cubes&#10;25 Orange Immigrant cubes&#10;25 Blue Immigrant cubes&#10;35 Green Political Favor Chips&#10;35 White Political Favor Chips&#10;35 Orange Political Favor Chips&#10;35 Blue Political Favor Chips&#10;20 Red Ward Boss Markers&#10;20 Yellow Ward Boss Markers&#10;20 Purple Ward Boss Markers&#10;20 Black Ward Boss Markers&#10;20 Neutral Ward Boss Markers&#10;15 Slander Chips&#10;2 Council President Markers&#10;1 Year Marker&#10;1 Political Favor Chip Sticker Sheet&#10;1 Drawstring Pouch&#10;&#10;";5;90;12;3;90;Tammany Hall;90;2007;Peter Dennis,Bryan Fischer;Negotiation,Political,Territory Building;Doug Eckhart;Cities: New York (New York, USA),Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Political: Elections;Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Variable Player Powers;IDW Games,Pandasaurus Games,StrataMax Games;7.2922600000000015;2551;tammany hall;20;0.0;0.0;3.4636363636363634;0;0.3;DuCfaVOsh7;False;0;5.0;90.0;13.0;3.0;60.0;Tammany Hall;55;3-5;98;60-90;34.96;69.95;38.57;0.0;1560;2007.0;tammany hall

A devastating sandstorm can throw your expedition into disarray, and cunning thieves lurk around the dig site ready to steal your prize discovery!&#10;&#10;The aim of the game is to make the most money by finding treasures and selling them to the museum.  Players find treasures by digging at the dig site (draw pile of cards).  Sets of treasures are collected over the course of the game and players choose the best time to sell them to the museum.  Once a player sells a treasure set to the museum the value of that set is credited to the player, and is no longer subject to loss or theft.&#10;&#10;If a player finds any maps at the dig site, he can use them to explore an ancient pyramid where more treasures are hidden.  Players can trade their treasures with the local marketplace to increase the value of their collection.

422;5411;31260;"Description from BoardgameNews&#10;&#10;In Agricola, you're a farmer in a wooden shack with your spouse and little else. On a turn, you get to take only two actions, one for you and one for the spouse, from all the possibilities you'll find on a farm: collecting clay, wood, or stone; building fences; and so on. You might think about having kids in order to get more work accomplished, but first you need to expand your house. And what are you going to feed all the little rugrats?&#10;&#10;The game supports many levels of complexity, mainly through the use (or non-use) of two of its main types of cards, Minor Improvements and Occupations. In the beginner's version (called the Family Variant in the U.S. release), these cards are not used at all. For advanced play, the U.S. release includes three levels of both types of cards; Basic (E-deck), Interactive (I-deck), and Complex (K-deck), and the rulebook encourages players to experiment with the various decks and mixtures thereof. Aftermarket decks such as the Z-Deck and the L-Deck also exist.&#10;&#10;Agricola is a turn-based game. There are 14 game rounds occurring in 6 stages, with a Harvest at the end of each stage (after Rounds 4, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 14).&#10;Each player starts with two playing tokens (farmer and spouse) and thus can take two turns, or actions, per round. There are multiple options, and while the game progresses, you'll have more and more: first thing in a round, a new action card is flipped over.&#10;Problem: Each action can be taken by only one player each round, so it's important to do some things with high preference.&#10;Each player also starts with a hand of 7 Occupation cards (of more than 160 total) and 7 Minor Improvement cards (of more than 140 total) that he/she may use during the game if they fit in his/her strategy. Speaking of which, there are countless strategies, some depending on your card hand. Sometimes it's a good choice to stay on course, and sometimes it is better to react to your opponents' actions.&#10;&#10;";5;150;12;1;30;Agricola;150;2007;Klemens Franz;Animals,Economic,Farming;Uwe Rosenberg;Agricola,Animals: Cattle,Animals: Horses,Animals: Pigs,Animals: Sheep,Harvest Series,Solitaire Games,Tableau Building;Card Drafting,Hand Management,Variable Player Powers,Worker Placement;Lookout Games,999 Games,Brain Games,Compaya.hu - Gamer Café Kft.,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Hobby Japan,Hobby World,HomoLudicus,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,Lacerta,Mayfair Games,MINDOK,Smart Ltd,Stratelibri,Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.,Ystari Games,Z-Man Games;8.055810000000001;48261;agricola;6;0.0;0.0;3.9141719745222954;0;0.6;DxWHvojIM1;True;33;5.0;60.0;12.0;1.0;30.0;Agricola;314;1-5;1997;30-60;32.19;87.95;59.95;0.0;3000;2007.0;agricola

Everyone knows their drivers -- the brave men and women who fear no danger and would, if the pay was good enough, even fly through Hell.&#10; Now you can join them. You will gain access to prefabricated spaceship components cleverly made from sewer pipes. Can you build a space ship durable enough to weather storms of meteors? Armed enough to defend against pirates? Big enough to carry a large crew and valuable cargo? Fast enough to get there first?&#10;&#10;Of course you can. Become a Galaxy Trucker. It's loads of fun.&#10;&#10;Galaxy Trucker is a tile laying game that plays out over two phases: building and flying. The goal is to have the most credits at the end of the game. You can earn credits by delivering goods, defeating pirates, building an efficient ship, and being the furthest along the track at the end of the flying phase.&#10;&#10;Building happens in real time and has players build their personal space ships by grabbing tiles from the middle of the table before the timer runs out. Tiles start out facedown so they won't know what they have until they take it, but they may choose to return it faceup if they don't want it. They must place the tiles they keep in a legal manner in their space ship. Usually this just means lining up the connectors appropriately (single to single, double to double, universal to anything) but also includes proper positioning of guns and engines. Tiles represent a variety of things including guns, engines, storage containers, crew cabins, shields, and batteries. They may also peek at the cards they will encounter in phase 2, but they must sacrifice building time to do this. At any time players may call their ships finished and take an order marker from the center.&#10;&#10;Once building is completed, and ships have been checked for errors, the flight begins. The flight cards are shuffled and player markers are placed on the flight board according to the order markers taken. Cards are revealed one at a time and players interact with them in order. They may include things such as pirates, abandoned vessels, disease outbreaks, meteor showers, worlds with goods to pick up, player-on-player combat zones, and other various things.&#10;&#10;Most of the cards will cause players to move back on the flight track and they must decide if the delay is worth their efforts. When all the cards are encountered players sell any goods they have collected, collect their rewards for finishing in first, second, or third place or having the most intact ship, and then lose some credits for damaged components. Space can be a very dangerous place and it is not uncommon to see your ship break into smaller and smaller pieces or lose some very valuable cargo off the side. If your ship gets damaged too much you can get knocked out of the race, so be careful!&#10;&#10;3 rounds of this are done, and in each round players get a bigger board to build a ship that can hold more components.

Disease, drought, and attacks from the Mongols may claim lives, but make sure you have enough money to offer a tribute to the Emperor.&#10;&#10;The game play is easier than it may appear. Every player has a set of &quot;person&quot; cards. Each round, you choose one action (most of which call on your workers' abilities) to help you prepare for the months ahead. Then you play one person card, recruiting that person and placing him into one of your palaces. Each person brings different skills and abilities to help you ride out the year. (Farmers help you gain rice to survive a drought month, Tax Collectors raise money, etc.) At the end of each round, that month's event is triggered, which may cost you some of your workers, some money, or give you points.&#10;&#10;Careful planning is the key to surviving &quot;the year of the dragon,&quot; but survival alone may not win you the game.&#10;&#10;";5;100;12;2;75;In the Year of the Dragon;100;2007;Harald Lieske,Michael Menzel;Economic,Medieval;Stefan Feld;Alea Big Box,Asian Theme,Country: China;Hand Management,Variable Phase Order;alea,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH,Broadway Toys LTD,Filosofia Éditions,Rio Grande Games;7.41498;8232;in the year of the dragon;83;0.0;0.0;3.5295698924731185;0;0.0;qNh8n6rojC;False;0;5.0;90.0;12.0;2.0;75.0;In the Year of the Dragon;93;2-5;351;75-90;44.99;0.0;61.95;0.0;507;2007.0;in the year of the dragon

The three types of pieces form a trinity: They cannot exist without each other. The aim is either to make the opponent run out of one of the three types of pieces or to put him in a position in which he cannot capture anymore. The tricky question the players will have to ask themselves on each of their turns is: &ldquo;Shall I make myself stronger or my opponent weaker?&rdquo; Meaning: Will you capture an opponent&rsquo;s piece and make him weaker, or will you jump on top of one of your own pieces and make yourself stronger? If you choose to jump on top of your own pieces too often, you will probably leave your opponent with too many pieces on the board. On the other hand, if you capture too often, you may end up with pieces that are not strong enough at the end of the game. What to do?

Second, if the shipment was of at least four crates, there is a flat bonus of 1 VP per crate.&#10;&#10;Third and most pivotally, there are VP that will be awarded at the beginning of the player's next and subsequent turns.  Each tea shipment is represented with cubes of the player's color (not the tea variety color) on a sort of barge.  The new shipment of tea is always placed, in the other of the two main board areas, at the top of a column of all the recent shipments (the number of total shipments varying with the number of players in the game), so that as more shipments are made, the old shipments drift farther down the column and eventually out of play.  At the beginning of your turn, you look to see where your shipments are in this column, and they pay out VP with better multipliers the higher they still are in the column.  This constitutes the driving force of the game, as nobody else wants to see your shipment at the top of the column for several turns in a row.  Players thus have an incentive to make a shipment even if they haven't yet assembled a large number of crates.&#10;&#10;It's a race to 100 points.  A runaway leader can easily take over if the rest of the table is not vigilant, so the best games of Darjeeling are those among vigilant players.&#10;&#10;";5;60;12;2;60;Darjeeling;60;2007;Christof Tisch;Economic,Farming;Günter Burkhardt;Country: India,Tea Games;Commodity Speculation,Grid Movement,Modular Board,Set Collection;ABACUSSPIELE,Corfix,Rio Grande Games;6.5709399999999984;1210;darjeeling;0;0.0;0.0;3.4333333333333336;0;0.2;6BAEMUD8jC;False;0;5.0;60.0;12.0;2.0;60.0;Darjeeling;15;2-5;101;60;39.95;0.0;49.95;37.37;186;2007.0;darjeeling
431;5514;32424;"1848 Australia, is a semi-historical railroad game from the 18xx set, and to which the designers credit some of this games' systems to the originator of the series - Francis Tresham.&#10;&#10;The game consists of two separate series of actions repeated until the game ends, these are stock rounds and operating rounds. During stock rounds, shares in the various railroading companies are bought &amp; sold by players and are tracked on the stock market mat. During operating rounds, the player/directors of those railroading companies are allowed to build track &amp; place station markers on the map, and then may buy trains from which to earn capital from running those trains along routes on the map. The capital earned may be paid out as dividends to shareholders or retained by the company for future expansion.&#10;&#10;The game ends at a pre-determined point, whereupon the player with the most worth,(cash on hand &amp; share certificate value) wins.&#10;&#10;As with many games in this series, there are similarities within the rules, but many feature slight differences, and it is these that give each individual 18xx game its character.&#10;&#10;1848 features an interesting array of differences described above. These include how private companies are purchased, the inclusion of The Bank Of England as a public company that extends loans and administers railroads that are in receivership, dealing with different track gauges between states and 'The Ghan' special train.&#10;&#10;";6;360;0;3;360;1848: Australia;360;2007;;Economic,Trains,Transportation;"Helmut Ohley,Leonhard ""Lonny"" Orgler";18xx,Country: Australia,Oceanian Theme;Auction/Bidding,Route/Network Building,Stock Holding,Tile Placement;(Self-Published),Double-O Games;7.8559;144;1848: australia;63;0.0;0.0;3.75;0;0.2;H2p50ZPajk;False;0;6.0;360.0;0.0;3.0;360.0;1848: Australia;4;3-6;27;360;59.95;118.95;68.99;0.0;239;2007.0;1848: australia

434;5525;32666;"In Wealth of Nations, you take on the role of a national leader.  Your goal is to take your nation from humble beginnings to the status of a world economic superpower.  You achieve this by building Industries, which allows you to produce Commodities.  There are six types of Industry tiles:  Farms, Generators, Academies, Mines, Factories, and Banks.  Each Industry is capable of producing a certain type of Commodity:  Food, Energy, Labor, Ore, and Capital (respectively).&#10;&#10;Each Commodity has one or more uses in the game.  For example, Food is required to &quot;feed&quot; your Industries when they produce, while Capital is used to build certain types of Industries.  As you build Industries, you create ever larger Industrial Blocs.  The larger a Bloc is, the greater your return on investment when the Bloc produces Commodities.&#10;&#10;The main focus of the game is trade.  Because it is economically unfeasible to produce every Commodity you need, you must engage in trade to get the Commodities that you require.  Each Commodity has a trade value influenced by the Markets.&#10;&#10;There is one Market for each type of Commodity.  If you can't gain a Commodity that you need by trading with your fellow players, you must buy it from the Market.  Buying a Commodity from the Market increases its price, reflecting increased demand.  Similarly, there are times when you can't unload your surplus Commodities because your fellow players have no need for them.  If you wish to earn money from these Commodities, you must sell them to the Market.  Selling a Commodity to the Market decreases its price, reflecting increased supply.&#10;&#10;As you build new Industries and earn more money, you acquire Victory Points.  The player with the most Victory Points at the end of the game, i.e., the player with the most valuable combination of Industries and money, is the winner.&#10;&#10;How will you build your Nation?&#10;&#10;";6;120;0;3;120;Wealth of Nations;120;2008;Gregor Benedetti;Economic,Industry / Manufacturing,Negotiation,Territory Building;Nico Carroll;;Commodity Speculation,Tile Placement,Trading;TableStar Games;6.9426;1596;wealth of nations;47;0.0;0.0;3.046875;0;0.0;Eo20cnbWi7;True;0;6.0;120.0;13.0;3.0;120.0;Wealth of Nations;16;3-6;35;120;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;114;2008.0;wealth of nations
435;5569;33160;"It is a time when the maps of the world are still being filled in. Seagoing empires expand their frontiers by sending ships to the farthest reaches of the globe in search of new lands, new alliances, and new conquests. &#30;The wealth of the newly-discovered worlds abroad is a tempting prize for those with the strength and the cunning to seize it... and to hold it!&#10;You represent a growing empire engaged in a glorious endeavor to expand your&#10;influence and status at home and across the great oceans of the world. Th&#30;rough exploration and shipping, colonization and war, you will struggle with the other great powers to control the resources and the regions that unfold before you.&#10;&#10;&#31;The goal in Endeavor is to earn the most glory for your empire. Players earn glory by increasing their scores in Industry, Culture, Finance, and Politics, as well as by occupying cities, controlling connections between cities, and by holding certain Asset Cards and Building Tiles. Short-term goals of constructing useful buildings, gathering Trade Tokens, and obtaining Asset Cards must be balanced with the overall goal of attaining glory as you compete for control over the various regions of the world. Th&#31;e game only lasts seven rounds, and when it is over you want to be the one who has earned the most Glory points!&#10;&#10;Each round every player gets to build a new building, based on their Industry track. They then obtain new population markers based on their Culture track and retrieve used markers from building based on their Finance track. During the action phase, players take turns to either activate a building using a population marker or spend trade tokens to take an action: Ship, Occupy, Attack, Payment or Draw. Some buildings and tokens allow a player to take one or both of two actions. Shipping is used to open new regions for Occupation and Drawing, and gains you Trade Tokens. Once a shipping track is full, the player with the most influence in that region gains the powerful Governor card for that region. Occupation of a city results in glory and Trade Tokens, while Attacking steals a city from an opponent! Either Occupation or Attacking can result in claiming the connection between two cities, if both connected cities are controlled by the same player. Drawing gains a card from a region up to the maximum hand limit based on the player's Politics track. A player's influence in a region determines which cards they can draw.

441;5613;34127;"A New Train Adventure Begins!&#10;&#10;The Ticket to Ride Card Game delivers all of the excitement, fun, and nail-biting tension of the original Ticket to Ride board game, but with several unique game-play twists in a new stand-alone, card game format.&#10;&#10;Players collect sets of illustrated Train cards, which are then used to complete Destination Tickets - routes between two cities depicted on each ticket. But before their Train cards can be used, players must face the risk of &quot;train robbing,&quot; where another player may force them to lose their hard-earned cards.&#10;&#10;Contains 96 illustrated train car cards, 46 destination tickets, 6 big city prize cards, and a rulebook.&#10;&#10;Part of the Ticket to Ride series.&#10;&#10;To begin the game, each player is dealt train car cards and destination ticket cards.  All these cards are kept secret from the other players until played or scored.  Each player may keep all his ticket cards, just one or any number in between.  A player's turn has two parts: first the player moves face up train car cards from his Railyard to his face down, On-the-Track stack; second the player may perform one of the following actions: 1) draw more train car cards, 2) place train car cards in his Railyard, or 3) draw destination tickets.  Like the original Ticket to Ride board game, when a player chooses to draw train car cards, he may choose from the five face up cards or draw from the top of the face down deck.  When placing cards in the Railyard, a player may place two or more cards of the same color including locomotives which are wild, or three cards, each of a different color.  Also when placing cards in the Railyard, a player may not play cards of the same color as those currently present in his Railyard nor of the same color as those present in any opponent's Railyard unless he plays more of that color than are present in the opponent's Railyard.  If the player plays more, then the opponent must discard his cards of that color.  This is called &quot;Train robbing.&quot;  When drawing destination tickets, a player draws four and may keep any number of them including none.&#10;&#10;When the train car card deck is exhausted in a two or three player game, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  In a four player game, completed tickets are scored and discarded train car cards are reshuffled into a new draw deck.  When that deck is exhausted, each player gets one more turn and the game ends.  At the end of the game all tickets not previously scored are scored.  The point values of completed tickets are added to a players score while those of tickets not completed are subtracted.  To complete tickets, players match train car cards in their On-the-Track stack by color and quantity with their tickets.  Each big city bonus is awarded to the player with the most completed tickets having that city.  These bonus points are added to the player's score.  The player scoring the most total points wins.&#10;&#10;";4;30;8;2;30;Ticket to Ride: The Card Game;30;2008;Cyrille Daujean,Julien Delval,Alan R. Moon;Card Game,Trains;Alan R.

442;5621;34219;"info from the designer's website&#10;&#10;THE GAME CONCEPT&#10;You are an abbot of a medieval monastery competing with other abbots to amass the greatest library of sacred books. To do so, you need to have both the workers and resources to run a well-functioning scriptorium. To acquire workers and resources, you use a limited supply of donated gold. In addition, you must be on good terms with the powerful bishop, who can help you in your quest.&#10;&#10;OUTLINE OF GAME PLAY&#10;The object of the game is to score the most Victory Points. You win Victory Points by winning any of the 5 categories: Illuminators, Scribes, Manuscripts, Scrolls, and Supplies. You win a category by having the highest total number of workers (Scribes, Illuminators) or resources (Manuscripts, Scrolls, Supplies) in that category. This is determined by the numbers in the upper left corner on the cards. At the start of the game, each category is worth 3 Victory Points. As the game progresses, the values on the Value Board will change and some categories will become worth more or less Victory Points than others. The game is divided into 2 stages: a Donation stage and an Auction stage. During the Donation stage, players acquire free cards according to an established plan. In the Auction stage, players purchase cards in auction rounds. After the two stages, winners of each category are determined and Victory Points awarded. The player with the most Victory Points wins.&#10;&#10;GAME CHARACTERISTICS&#10;The game involves a good deal of strategic planning, some bluffing, and a little bit of luck. The rules are easy to understand, but you have to play it a few times to develop a playing strategy. It plays differently from 2-4 players, but each game is equally fun and challenging.&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;87 Total Cards&#10;1 Scriptorium&#10;5 Six-Sided Dice (5 different colors)&#10;1 Rule Book&#10;&#10;Card Size:&#10;Standard Card Game (Magic the Gathering and similar CCG's)&#10;&#10;";4;30;10;2;30;Biblios;30;2007;Steve Finn,David Palumbo;Card Game,Economic,Medieval,Religious;Steve Finn;;Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Hand Management,Memory,Press Your Luck,Set Collection;Asterion Press,Dr. Finn's Games,Hobby Japan,HomoLudicus,IELLO,Kaissa Chess & Games,More Fun Co., Ltd.,One Moment Games,Rocks Games;7.24897;9897;biblios;37;2.0;3.0;3.5082330345710644;0;0.17;a17hwVmwdO;False;11;4.0;45.0;10.0;2.0;30.0;Biblios;284;2-4;1767;30-45;20.79;33.99;22.79;0.0;2052;2007.0;biblios
443;5630;34297;"The Climbers / Die Aufsteiger is an easy-to-learn, all-wooden, 3D strategy game with beautiful components, which include 35 colorful blocks of different sizes, a climber pawn for each player, a blocking stone for each player, and a short and a long ladder for each player.  Starting with all the blocks in a random tower, players move a block and then climb up the tower gradually -- without ladders for small steps up, and with ladders for larger climbs.  Blocking stones keep the block in place and unoccupied for one round, but you can only use your blocking stones and each ladder once during the game.  The winner is whoever gets to the highest point first when no one can go higher for one round.  You can only climb onto surfaces that are the same color as your climber or gray (a neutral color any climbers can use).  Alternate rules allow for simultaneous movement and using ladders as bridges.&#10;&#10;";5;45;8;2;45;The Climbers;45;2008;;Abstract Strategy,Racing;Holger Lanz;3D Games;Modular Board,Tile Placement;Chili Spiele,Strategic Space;6.88057;916;the climbers;10;0.0;0.0;3.3354166666666667;0;0.46;Qqjo8aF5fj;True;0;5.0;60.0;8.0;2.0;45.0;The Climbers;72;2-5;352;45-60;26.99;64.99;45.95;0.0;666;2008.0;the climbers
444;5645;34635;"The &quot;Stone Age&quot; times were hard indeed. In their roles as hunters, collectors, farmers, and tool makers, our ancestors worked with their legs and backs straining against wooden plows in the stony earth. Of course, progress did not stop with the wooden plow. People always searched for better tools and more productive plants to make their work more effective.&#10;&#10;In Stone Age, the players live in this time, just as our ancestors did. They collect wood, break stone and wash their gold from the river. They trade freely, expand their village and so achieve new levels of civilization. With a balance of luck and planning, the players compete for food in this pre-historic time.&#10;&#10;Players use up to ten tribe members each in three phases. In the first phase, players place their men in regions of the board that they think will benefit them, including the hunt, the trading center, or the quarry. In the second phase, the starting player activates each of his staffed areas in whatever sequence he chooses, followed in turn by the other players. In the third phase, players must have enough food available to feed their populations, or they face losing resources or points.&#10;&#10;Rules: http://www.zmangames.com/uploads/4/7/1/7/47170931/en-stone_age-rules-2013.pdf&#10;&#10;";4;90;10;2;60;Stone Age;90;2008;Michael Menzel;Dice,Prehistoric;Bernd Brunnhofer;Stone Age;Dice Rolling,Set Collection,Worker Placement;Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH,999 Games,Bard Centrum Gier,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Kaissa Chess & Games,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,Lautapelit.fi,MINDOK,Piatnik,Rio Grande Games,Stupor Mundi,Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.,Z-Man Games,Zvezda;7.6334;30432;stone age;5;3.0;3.0;3.644193048576217;0;-0.45;BUDJJb08Uj;False;8;5.0;90.0;13.0;2.0;60.0;Stone Age;398;2-5;2653;60-90;72.53;52.99;50.99;39.99;3485;2008.0;stone age

As an action, players may choose either to take all goods of one type from an offer space or to use one of the available buildings. Building actions allow players to upgrade goods, sell them or use them to build their own buildings and ships. Buildings are both an investment opportunity and a revenue stream, as players must pay an entry fee to use buildings that they do not own. Ships, on the other hand, are primarily used to provide the food that is needed to feed the workers.&#10;&#10;After every seven turns, the round ends: players' cattle and grain may multiply through a Harvest, and players must feed their workers.

Conquer.&#10;&#10;The Duke is a dynamic, tile-based strategy game with an old-world, feudal theme, high-quality wooden playing pieces, and an innovative game mechanism in its double-sided tiles. Each side represents a different posture &ndash; often considered to be defensive or offensive &ndash; and demonstrates exactly what the piece can do within the turn. At the end of a move (or after the use of a special ability), the tile is flipped to its other side, displaying a new offensive or defensive posture.&#10;&#10;Each posture conveys different options for maneuver and attack. The full circle is a standard Move, the hollow circle the Jump, the arrow provides for the Slide, the star a special Strike ability and so on. Each turn a player may select any tile to maneuver, attempting to defend his own troops while positioning himself to capture his opponent's tiles. If you end your movement in a square occupied by an opponent's tile, you capture that tile. Capture your opponent's Duke to win!&#10;&#10;Players start the game by placing their Duke in one of the two middle squares on their side of the game board. Two Footman are then placed next to the Duke. Each turn a player may choose to either move a single tile or randomly draw a new tile from the bag. With fifteen different Troop Tiles, all double-sided, and nineteen total pieces for each player (plus special optional tiles), the variety of game play is limitless.&#10;&#10;Beyond the endless variety of the basic game, Terrain Tiles introduce a variety of game play options, altering the game board.

BlackSheep is perfect for two to four players ages eight and up. -From the FFG website.&#10;&#10;There's a lot of randomness here, but also room for elementary strategy.  Players make poker hands from two shared cards (figurines of ranked animals) and three of their own (these are actual cards).  There are three such hands playing simultaneously, with players adding one or two cards at a time to any hand on their turn.  When all players have played three cards onto a hand, a winner is chosen, based on the poker ranks.  The winner takes the two shared cards (animal figurines), and new shared cards are added.  At the end of the game, scores are calculated by summing numbers printed on the bottoms of the figurines they captured and some bonuses.

The sub is descending and the water pressure increasing, the nuclear reactor is overheating, the nuclear missile launchers are pre-igniting, fires and water leaks are everywhere, there's a giant Kraken looming nearby and there&rsquo;s very little oxygen and vodka left. While the storyline feels more and more like a disaster movie, the players must get organized to solve the problems, divide the tasks among themselves to minimize the risks, and sometimes accept to sacrifice themselves for the common cause.&#10;&#10;The game is played on the map of the submarine. The conditions in the submarine are represented by three disaster tracks: Asphyxiation, Heat and Pressure. During the game, these conditions get worse, and if anyone of them reaches its maximum value, the submarine is lost. In addition, various emergencies can occur which have to be dealt with swiftly, or they'll also lead to the loss of the submarine.&#10;&#10;Each turn, a player can move to a new location, and perform some action there. Such an action can be repairs (which will improve conditions on the sub and/or fix emergencies), removing obstacles (unblocking hatches, removing flooding or extinguishing fires) or stocking up on equipment (which will help with later actions). Each action is paid for with time. The more time a player spends on an action, the greater the chance of success. After each player's turn, a number of events will happen; the more time was spent, the more events will occur. Such events will be the worsening of conditions in the submarine, or the triggering of emergencies.&#10;&#10;If the Gnomes can keep alive long enough, rescue will arrive and the game is won.&#10;&#10;";8;120;13;1;60;Red November;120;2008;Bruno Faidutti,Jef Gontier,Christophe Madura;Fantasy,Humor,Nautical;Bruno Faidutti,Jef Gontier;Fantasy Flight Silver Line Games,Solitaire Games,Steampunk;Area Movement,Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Time Track;Arclight,Edge Entertainment,Fantasiapelit,Fantasy Flight Games,Galakta,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Nexus,Ubik,Wargames Club Publishing;6.35591;6808;red november;26;0.0;0.0;3.0199999999999987;0;0.0;EhRePxcnA9;True;0;8.0;120.0;13.0;1.0;60.0;Red November;74;1-8;114;60-120;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;593;2008.0;red november
462;5795;37046;"Ghost Stories is a cooperative game in which the players protect the village from incarnations of the lord of hell &ndash; Wu-Feng &ndash; and his legions of ghosts before they haunt a town and recover the ashes that will allow him to return to life. Each Player represents a Taoist monk working together with the others to fight off waves of ghosts.&#10;&#10;The players, using teamwork, will have to exorcise the ghosts that appear during the course of the game. At the beginning of his turn, a player brings a ghost into play and places it on a free spot, and more than one can come in at the same time. The ghosts all have abilities of their own &ndash; some affecting the Taoists and their powers, some causing the active player to roll the curse die for a random effect, and others haunting the villager tiles and blocking that tile's special action. On his turn, a Taoist can move on a tile in order to exorcise adjacent ghosts or to benefit from the villager living on the tile, providing it is not haunted. Each tile of the village allows the players to benefit from a different bonus. With the cemetery, for example, Taoists can bring a dead Taoist back to life, while the herbalist allows to recover spent Tao tokens, etc. It will also be possible to get traps or move ghosts or unhaunt other village tiles.&#10;&#10;To exorcise a ghost, the Taoist rolls three Tao dice with different colors: red, blue, green, yellow, black, and white. If the result of the roll matches the color(s) of the ghost or incarnation of Wu-Feng, the exorcism succeeds. The white result is a wild color that can be used as any color. For example, to exorcise a green ghost with 3 resistance, you need to roll three green, three white, or a combination of both. If your die rolls fall short, you can also use Tao tokens that match the color in addition to your roll. You may choose to use these after your roll. Taoists gain these tokens by using certain village tiles or by exorcising certain ghosts. One of the Taoists has a power that allows him to receive such a token once per turn.&#10;&#10;To win, the players must defeat the incarnation of Wu-Feng, a boss who arrives at the end of the game. There are also harder difficulty levels that add more incarnations of Wu-Feng, in which to win, you must defeat all of them.&#10;&#10;There are many more ways to lose, however. The players lose if three of the village's tiles are haunted, if the draw pile is emptied while the incarnation of Wu-Feng is still in play, or if all the priests are dead.&#10;&#10;";4;60;12;1;60;Ghost Stories;60;2008;Pierô;Fantasy,Fighting,Horror,Mythology;Antoine Bauza;Asian Theme,Ghost Stories,Ghosts,Solitaire Games;Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Grid Movement,Modular Board,Variable Player Powers;Repos Production,Asmodee,Lautapelit.fi,REBEL.pl;7.3889;14147;ghost stories;42;0.0;0.0;3.456887755102041;0;-0.36;cjyxU3TeXF;False;14;4.0;75.0;12.0;1.0;60.0;Ghost Stories;196;1-4;792;60-75;67.75;54.99;29.98;31.19;1979;2008.0;ghost stories

469;5853;37904;"Formula D is a high stakes Formula One type racing game where the players race simulated cars with the hope of crossing the finish line first.  This is a re-release of Formula D&#195;&#169; with several changes from the original format. Whilst old tracks can be used with the updated Formula D rules, the new game features boards that have an F1 track and a Street Track on the other side. These street tracks each have a novel inclusion or two to add greater theme -&#10;&#10;The game mechanisms are a simple race, get to the finish line first!  However, players have to use a significant amount of planning, and rely on quite a bit of luck.  Each player manages when to shift gears, with each gear providing a different speed.  (For example, 4th gear is a die that rolls random numbers from 7 to 12 for spaces moved.)  Each turn, players may move up one gear, stay in that gear, or move down gears.  This forces players to match possible rolls with the optimum distance for that turn, and hopefully plan ahead.  However, speed is not the only issue!  Corners have a &quot;stop&quot; rule that requires players to stop once, twice, or three times on that corner in consecutive turns or face a penalty.  This creates an effective speed limit to the corners. &#10; Of course, things do not always go as planned!  Players take penalties if they miss their roll, bump into another car, are blocked by other cars, have to brake heavily, or have to downshift several gears.  These are taken off of a car&rsquo;s attributes (Tire health, Brake wear, Transmission Gears, Body, engine, and Suspension).  Losing the maximum in any of these categories will result in elimination, or a severe setback for that car.  This requires that players manage their car&rsquo;s health, plan for their best path, and have good luck on their rolls.  This high amount of luck gives the game its family appeal, and lets weaker players have a chance at winning once in a while.&#10;&#10;However, the fun does not end with a single race!  The rules include the ability to customize your cars, use a pre-generated character, add Slipstreaming (Drafting) rules and road debris, and change tire types to modify your distance rolls.  There are also variations for a single lap race, or multiple laps with pit stops to repair some of your damage points.  In addition, numerous expansion tracks can be purchased to vary the demands on each driver and car.  Each track may also have weather effects (rain) that change car handling and die rolls due to skidding on wet track.  This opens up the game for rally rules giving championship points over a number of races.&#10;&#10;Formula D adds a few items that are not in the original Formula De:  There is the added excitement of illegal racing in the streets of big cities - anything goes!  This adds custom cars, nitro acceleration, drifting in the curves, dirty tricks, gun battles, and trash on the road to add more variation.  A basic change is the use of a &quot;Dashboard&quot; with movable pegs to manage your car&rsquo;s attributes instead of the paper forms from Formula De.  There are also two sets of pre-painted cars; a Formula 1 set and the Street Race set of stock cars.  The street cars come with &quot;Character&quot; profiles to give a bit of role-playing to the game.  Finally, the old category of &quot;Fuel&quot; for the car has been renamed Transmission Wear to give a better thematic fit to the effect of multiple downshifting.&#10;&#10;The popularity of this game has given it a lot of expansions, some simplifications to the rules (See Formula D&#195;&#169; Mini), and a lot of &quot;after market&quot; parts.  There are also fan expansions and tracks for the very dedicated player.  In many ways, this has become a multiple game system.&#10;&#10;";10;60;8;2;60;Formula D;60;2008;Nicolas Caniaux,Stéphane Poinsot,Arnaud Simon-Laforet;Racing,Sports;Laurent Lavaur,Eric Randall;Country: Monaco,Formula De/De mini/D,Sports: Auto Racing;Dice Rolling,Grid Movement,Player Elimination,Press Your Luck,Roll / Spin and Move,Simulation;ADC Blackfire Entertainment,Asmodee,Idea Edizioni;7.05892;12145;formula d;5;0.0;0.0;3.261363636363636;0;0.26;OaNtyb98cm;False;7;10.0;90.0;10.0;2.0;60.0;Formula D;198;2-10;633;60-90;44.49;41.99;62.99;38.16;1795;2008.0;formula d

Forward speed (and distance moved) = dog1 + dog2 - brake + bonus (=position in race) if (dog1 = dog2). Lateral movement distance = dog1 - dog2 (move to the side with the stronger dog). Certain parts of the track have speed limits; you take damage if you exceed them, or if you run into obstacles (ice patches, side of track, etc.). Damage = cards that take up space in your hand (so 5th damage --&gt; out of the race!).&#10;&#10;The first player to cross the finish line wins!&#10;&#10;";5;60;10;2;45;Snow Tails;60;2008;Bertrand Benoit,Stéphane Gantiez,Gordon Lamont,Fraser Lamont,Judith Lamont,Beth Sobel;Animals,Racing,Sports;Gordon Lamont,Fraser Lamont;Admin: Better Description Needed!,Animals: Dogs,Arctic Theme,Sports: Winter Sports;Hand Management,Modular Board,Player Elimination;Fragor Games,Asmodee,Renegade Game Studios;6.99959;4848;snow tails;39;0.0;0.0;3.4579782608695657;0;0.0;v8NDrj9P02;False;0;5.0;60.0;10.0;2.0;45.0;Snow Tails;69;2-5;222;45-60;0.0;0.0;49.95;34.98;844;2008.0;snow tails

A player keeps the dice from their previous turn and may, if desired, add or subtract a die from these to accelerate or slow on their current turn.  Any or all dice used in the previous turn may be left at their current values or rerolled.  Once the roll is complete the player chooses a direction of travel, either straight or one hex side (60 degrees) to the left or right, and if the complete distance cannot be travelled the boat incurs damage.  Too much damage will sink your powerboat and penalise you for the next race.  The buoys change positions for each successive race and, after three races, players add up their points to determine the winner.

479;5959;38996;"(from GMT's website:)&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War is the long awaited re-design of the original card driven game, We the People. Washington's War, like its predecessor, pits the forces of a world power (England) against its rebellious American colonists as they fight for their independence.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War is a true re-design that maintains the deep strategy of We the People while creating a game with a very short playing time (approximately 90 minutes). Unlike most wargames, Washington's War allows you and your opponent to play twice while switching sides in one sitting. This feature allows for rapid tournament play either face-to-face or on the Internet. Washington's War is the perfect antidote for a time conscious crowd whose only option up to now have been Eurogames.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War features a dice-driven combat system that quickly resolves combat and is very friendly to Internet play. The game also features a new CDG discard mechanic that makes every card in your hand playable by allowing your opponent to buy his discarded events for an operations card. Now, unusual card distributions create challenges and not insurmountable barriers for advancing your strategy.&#10;&#10;The biggest design changes between We the People and Washington's War, besides the aforementioned new game mechanics, is the increased emphasis on the asymmetrical capabilities of the two sides. The British are a conventional army with a dominant naval capability that gives them great strengths in the coastal regions. The Americans are an unconvential force with a small Contintental Army led by George Washington who yearn for French intervention. While the British struggle to expand their influence inland, the Americans struggle to keep their militia forces in the field. In the end it is the side that is better able to play to their strengths and protect their vulnerabilities that prevails in Washington's War.&#10;&#10;Washington&rsquo;s War was broadly tested on the Internet in a tournament format to ensure clarity of rules under the stresses of competition. What was old is new again...be the man on the white horse and father a new nation, or be a king trying to save his empire during a world war.&#10;&#10;COMPONENTS:&#10; * 2 Double-thick Counter Sheets&#10; * MOUNTED 22&quot;x34&quot; Map&#10; * 110 Event Cards&#10; * 2 6-sided dice&#10; * Rule Book&#10; * Play Book&#10; * 2 Player Aid Cards&#10;&#10;PUBLISHED: 2010&#10;DESIGNER: Mark Herman&#10;DEVELOPER: Joel Toppen&#10;ART DIRECTOR: Rodger B.

488;6039;40251;"Risk Balance of Power is a two-player version of Risk on a map covering a large part of Europe (Iberia and the Balkans do not partake). The map is divided into 6 regions consisting of 30 territories. Some of the territories contain rough terrain and are harder to attack.&#10;&#10;There are 4 different basic starting setups for the 2 players. All of them include a neutral player. To win, a player must keep his capital and achieve 3 goals. All goals are public. For each setup a different combination of 8 of the available 12 goals is used.&#10;&#10;In the Command Centre version, one player sets up both sides and the neutrals then the other choses which one to play and who starts. Each side is able to add support to the neutral player, and your defeated armies can be used to gain special bonuses. One of the bonuses even allows you to attack with (some) neutral armies.&#10;&#10;Armies are still raised based on the number of territories and any regions you own, but also on the number of cities. As in standard risk, area cards are still gained upon conquering a territory, and can still be used to raise additional armies. The army units are in the shape of small (flat) arrows.&#10;&#10;Manufacturer's description (translated from the Dutch edition):&#10;RISK for 2 players.

One player is Austria, the second is France plus Bavaria, while the third player plays as Prussia (Austria's enemy) and the Pragmatic Army (Austria's ally) at the same time. This is made possible by the division of the map into two parts, the Flanders map and the Bohemia map.&#10;&#10;MARIA is derived from the award-winning Friedrich, but has its very own character, including politics, hussars, force marches, imperial election, Saxony's betrayal and Prussia's annexation of Silesia. Subtle maneuvers, seizure of fortresses, prudent retreats, and Machiavellian politics are the keys to victory. However, players must be careful: whoever uses his Tactical Cards unwisely in battle can suddenly find himself not on the highway to glory but on the road to ruin.&#10;&#10;MARIA takes you to the era of the 18th century's ruthless struggle for power.

493;6071;40603;"INCURSION is set in the world of Secrets of the Third Reich and is the ultimate combination of board game and miniatures game. Armored troopers of the US &ldquo;Lucky Seventh&rdquo; and stalwart commandos of the United Kingdom&rsquo;s MI-13 hurtle through underground bunkers and combat the monstrous forces of the German SWD in a furious race against time. The Doomsday Device is ticking and neither the Allies nor the Axis can fail. This two player game features a tight storyline campaign that culminates in an epic and desperate climax. The game mechanics are simple to grasp allowing players to instantly focus on their tactical options. Game play is incredibly fast-paced and tense and players choose their forces through a card-based Requisition Point system. The game is played on a board with a special card deck and highly detailed 30mm metal miniatures. You can also use the miniatures in games of Secrets of the Third Reich. Rules can be found for them here.&#10;&#10;In 1946, after stunning German victories on both fronts largely attributed to Vergeltungswaffe 4, a compound that kills painfully and resurrects corpses as dangerous animate objects, Franco joined the Axis. Spanish forces backed by Brandenburger commandos and Fallschirmjager Drop Armor assaulted the British held rock of Gibraltar. Germany claimed the ancient fort with its network of caves and aggressively expanded it into a vast underground research, command, and control center, plumbing the depths of the Rock. In 1949, allied forces mount a massive offensive to retake it. The campaign is bloody and hard-fought but ultimately successful. German and Spanish personnel escape by U-boat from underwater chambers. US and British forces enter the German compound only to be beaten back by the horrors that lurk within the vast twisted labyrinth under Gibraltar. Many commanders feel that the only recourse is to seal the caves from the surface, so that is done. Unfortunately it is impossible to determine the lo cation of all of the undersea tunnels. Zombie naval mines damage or destroy numerous smaller vessels and sink the aircraft carrier Lexington as they sally forth from these undersea caves. MI-13 stumbles onto communiqu&eacute;s detailing German SWD plans for a diabolical Doomsday Device under Gibraltar. Given the effectiveness of previous SWD attacks, the credibility of these reports cannot be ignored. The decision is made to clear the caves. MI-13 Commandos and elements of the US Lucky Seventh invade the stronghold in a desperate race to shut down the Doomsday Device before it can be deployed.&#10;&#10;Contents:&#10;&#10;Rigid two piece box covered in art&#10;Glossy 28 page rulebook&#10;Card rules summary/playsheet&#10;4 sheets of two-sided heavy-duty die cut pieces (132 total) including counters, doors and stand-ups for all models&#10;Super Heavy duty two-sided six-fold game board&#10;86 cards (66 card Battle Deck and 10 Model Cards for each side)&#10;3 black dice&#10;36 black plastic stand-up holders for doors and &quot;models&quot;&#10;Vac-formed plastic holding tray&#10;&#10;";2;120;0;2;120;Incursion;120;2009;David Ausloos,Keith Lowe,Tears of Envy;Dice,Miniatures,Science Fiction,Wargame,World War II;Jim Bailey;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter;Action Point Allowance System,Dice Rolling,Grid Movement,Variable Player Powers;Grindhouse Games;7.7055;329;incursion;20;0.0;0.0;3.285714285714286;0;0.0;HWxD1ALgeU;False;0;2.0;120.0;0.0;2.0;120.0;Incursion;7;2;10;120;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;132;2009.0;incursion

495;6079;40692;"In Small World, players vie for conquest and control of a world that is simply too small to accommodate them all.&#10;&#10;Designed by Philippe Keyaerts as a fantasy follow-up to his award-winning Vinci, Small World is inhabited by a zany cast of characters such as dwarves, wizards, amazons, giants, orcs, and even humans, who use their troops to occupy territory and conquer adjacent lands in order to push the other races off the face of the earth.&#10;&#10;Picking the right combination from the 14 different fantasy races and 20 unique special powers, players rush to expand their empires - often at the expense of weaker neighbors. Yet they must also know when to push their own over-extended civilization into decline and ride a new one to victory!&#10;&#10;On each turn, you either use the multiple tiles of your chosen race (type of creatures) to occupy adjacent (normally) territories - possibly defeating weaker enemy races along the way, or you give up on your race letting it go &quot;into decline&quot;. A race in decline is designated by flipping the tiles over to their black-and-white side.&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, you score one point (coin) for each territory your races occupy. You may have one active race and one race in decline on the board at the same time. Your occupation total can vary depend on the special abilities of your race and the territories they occupy. After the final round, the player with the most coins wins.&#10;&#10;Clarifications: available in a pinned forum post.&#10;&#10;";5;80;8;2;40;Small World;80;2009;Miguel Coimbra,Cyrille Daujean;Fantasy,Fighting,Territory Building;Philippe Keyaerts;Small World;Area Control / Area Influence,Area Movement,Dice Rolling,Variable Player Powers;Days of Wonder,Asterion Press,Bergsala Enigma,Compaya.hu - Gamer Café Kft.,Edge Entertainment,Galápagos Jogos,Hobby Japan,Hobby World,REBEL.pl,Siam Board Games,Stratelibri;7.35735;43144;small world;8;2.0;2.333333333333333;3.4084175637483503;0;0.1;8UmzC1ZGGE;False;0;5.0;80.0;8.0;2.0;40.0;Small World;563;2-5;2085;40-80;44.99;64.95;62.89;37.59;3043;2009.0;small world

Each turn, a player will put together a poker hand and depending on the roll, take control of various key places in Dice Town that will allow him to perform the corresponding action of the location.&#10;&#10;In a turn, all players shake their cup and take out all but one die, which is kept apart from the others. They repeat the process with the remaining dice until all five dice are on the table. Players may want to keep more than one die; they pay one dollar for each additional die.&#10;&#10;Now the locations are checked...&#10;&#10;Nines: In the gold mine, the player with the most 9's may take one nugget from the mine for each nine he has thrown.&#10;&#10;Tens: In the bank, the player with the most 10's may rob the bank and take all bills there - each two bills represent one victory point at game end.&#10;&#10;Jacks: The player who has the most J's goes to the general store and draws as many cards as he had thrown J's, keeping one.

There are many more cards of this kind that spice up the game.&#10;&#10;Queens: The player with the most Q's in his roll wins the favor of the girls, and takes advantage of their charm to steal from an opponent.

500;6108;41002;"Recruit workers, buy projects, build ships. And use the ships to open new commercial routes to eastern Africa and India, to earn money and glory.&#10;&#10;This is a resource management game, with an element of risk management, that works like this:&#10;&#10;Beginning with the start player, each player takes one numbered disc and places it on top of his own coloured disc in one of the four action areas of the board. A Vasco da Gama tile states a number; everything above this number is free of charge, anything below will have to be paid for, so players will take this into account when taking numbered discs. When all players have placed four discs, a modifier to this 'activation number' is shown, and discs are worked by number. In the crew area players may hire crew and a captain, but this costs money. Each round there is a window of ships. The number on the left is the navigation strength, the number on the right is the required amount of different crew. Players choose a ship, pay for the crew and turn the tile to its other side - with a captain on top. In the navigation area, a player takes his ship and places it in a row of his choice, but he has to take care not to exceed the navigation strength of the ship.&#10;&#10;The game lasts five rounds, after which the player with the most points has won.&#10;&#10;A brief description from the rule book:&#10;&#10;Vasco da Gama was charged with finding a maritime route to India.&#10;&#10;Players play the part of rich shipowners who, under his patronage, aim to achieve prestige and riches. &#10;To succeed in the enterprise, they must manage the money and actions at their disposal in order to hire captains, recruit crew, build ships, launch them, and send them to the landings of Natal, Terra de Boa Gente, Mozambique, Malindi, Mombasa, and Calicut.&#10;&#10;For each ship sent, players will receive an immediate reward and will gain prestige (Victory Points). &#10;The farther the ship is sent, the lower the compensation, but the higher the victory score that the player will earn.&#10;&#10;Ships at landings that are &quot;complete&quot; at the end of the round (i.e. reached by a certain number of Ships) will earn further Victory Points for their owners and will then advance, under certain conditions, to the next Landing. This creates the opportunity to earn again Victory Points in the following Rounds.&#10;&#10;During each Round, Players take actions in various Areas (Navigation, Recruiting, or Purchase Projects or Characters).&#10;Planning is fundamental: The right to take an Action could be free of charge or paid for.&#10;&#10;The earlier a Player plans to take an Action, the more likely that he will have to pay for it.&#10;&#10;Players will have to ask themselves if and how much they are ready to pay for the right to act first in a certain area.&#10;&#10;Vasco da Gama himself will decide which is the first free of charge Action for each Round. He will also help some of the Players by making some money available to them.&#10;&#10;This great maritime enterprise raises the interest of 4 influential Characters.&#10;Aiming to have a substantial role in the development of the new commercial route, they will also provide their favors free of charge to the Players.&#10;&#10;Francisco Alvares (The Priest) will make available a number of Missionaries to be used as crew members, Girolamo Sernigi (The Merchant) will organize Ships built and manned, Bartolomeu Dias (The Leader) will grant an increased initiative and additional Victory Points, and Manuel 1st (The King) will allow Players to take an additional Action in the name of the Portuguese Kingdom.&#10;&#10;The winner is the Player with the highest Victory Points score at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;";4;120;12;2;60;Vasco da Gama;120;2009;Mariano Iannelli;Nautical,Renaissance;Paolo Mori;Colonial Theme,Country: Portugal;Action / Movement Programming,Press Your Luck,Tile Placement,Worker Placement;999 Games,hobbity.eu,Hutter Trade GmbH + Co KG,IELLO,Lautapelit.fi,Rio Grande Games,What's Your Game?;7.321510000000001;3721;vasco da gama;33;0.0;0.0;3.256756756756757;0;0.0;pInDr4H3nm;False;0;4.0;120.0;12.0;2.0;60.0;Vasco Da Gama;37;2-4;56;60-120;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;332;2009.0;vasco da gama

For three to five rounds, they must depend on each other to carry out missions against the Empire. At the same time, they must try to deduce the other players&rsquo; identities and gain their trust.

Everyone votes on whether or not to approve the assignment. Once an assignment passes, the chosen players secretly decide to Support or Sabotage the mission.

504;6129;41186;"At first you think you are playing good old Monopoly where they just add some extra buildings to give a little twist. But the longer you play, the more you realise they actually made a whole new game. You start with more money than usual, which gives you the idea you will last longer (with a bit of luck maybe). The fact that now you can build right away when you bought a property, gives so much dynamic to the game. No more waiting until you have the whole set, or not having the set because one player refuses to trade. Even with a couple of single properties you can win the game.&#10;&#10;But not so fast. Everybody wants to win of course. And with the 80 extra buildings they added to the game, nothing was ever so uncertain. On every property you can build residential or industrial buildings. The first is not protected against negative buildings (hazards) and requires positive buildings otherwise the property becomes worthless. The industrial buildings on the other hand are protected but they cost twice as much! So you will have to make choice. And the added electronic device will, besides timing deals, always indicate how many buildings you can exactly make.&#10;&#10;There is also no community chest anymore, only chance. But they have changed the content of the cards which makes the game less predictable and more fun to play- watch your buildings being crushed because of an earthquake or not getting your rent because a player evades the number thrown with the dice.&#10;&#10;Besides these changes, there are many more twists to the game which I will not reveal here but be sure that they all add to the greatness that once was and that now has even become better.&#10;&#10;Monopoly City made its first public appearance at the Nuremberg Toy Fair 2009.&#10;&#10;";6;75;8;2;75;Monopoly City;75;2009;(Uncredited);City Building,Economic,Electronic,Negotiation;(Uncredited);3D Games,Monopoly;Auction/Bidding,Dice Rolling,Roll / Spin and Move,Set Collection,Trading;Hasbro,Parker Brothers,Parker Spiele;5.68825;704;monopoly city;79;0.0;0.0;2.0;0;0.0;v22MeBJrl4;False;0;6.0;75.0;8.0;2.0;75.0;Monopoly City;5;2-6;8;75;107.45;0.0;0.0;0.0;77;2009.0;monopoly city

506;6138;41429;"Band of Brothers is a fast playing game of squad level combat in WWII.  It covers the exploits of the 101st in their battles from D-Day through the Bulge. The rules are very simple (no combat charts are needed) with very few exceptions to remember and yet the game is meant to be all encompassing and will include infantry, tanks, and artillery.&#10;&#10;Based on years of research, the game system uses a unique suppression mechanic.  There are no longer two unique states for a unit, but varying degrees of suppression.  This allows suppression to accumulate from multiple fire sources and means that the unit will not take a morale check until it is asked to do something.  You will never know for sure how your units will respond until they are needed.&#10;&#10;Although casualties can be caused by artillery and heavy weapons (which makes them prime battlefield targets), squads will never cause significant casualties shooting at range at dug in, first line troops.  Their goal is to fire and maneuver.  Sections of the enemy force must be pinned down and eliminated from up close.  The system itself forces this realistic play.  In a similar fashion, the system rewards you for spreading your troops out and other realistic game play.&#10;&#10;Another unique feature of the game is its use of Proficiency and Casualty ratings to differentiate squads in areas besides just morale.&#10;&#10;The game is the first in a series.&#10;&#10;Band of Brothers:  Ghost Panzer is a stand alone game that is set on the Eastern Front and follows the German 11th Panzer (Ghost) Division&#10;&#10;Other games under research are &quot;The Old Breed&quot; (the US 1st Marine Division) and a module that follows Commonwealth forces.&#10;&#10;";2;90;12;2;90;Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles;90;2011;Michael Evans (II),Christopher Ono,Brandon Pennington,Dan Safee;Wargame,World War II;Jim Krohn;Band of Brothers,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter;Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Modular Board;Worthington Games,Worthington Publishing, LLC;7.89142;403;band of brothers: screaming eagles;83;0.0;0.0;3.7045454545454537;0;0.0;tqSGLUVGf8;False;0;2.0;90.0;12.0;2.0;90.0;Band of Brothers: Screaming Eagles;11;2;13;90;60.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;508;2011.0;band of brothers: screaming eagles

In their quest for power (points), players build Ziggurats (permanent outposts), wells, make sacrifices to gods and try to get along with nobles of Assur - the capital of Assyria. The game is a light-weight eurogame, built around the short-term rapid point gains vs long-term investments dilemma. General flow of play is as follows:&#10;&#10;Phase 1: Players get resources for expansion and decide on play order&#10;&#10;In this phase, players pick cards with resources that enable expansion on the board. In general he/she who gets most food, plays last. First player expands with least food.&#10;&#10;Phase 2: Players expand on the board to earn points or money.&#10;&#10;Players begin to form strings and/or clusters of huts and pay for placing them with their food cards. Depending on where huts are placed, they either score points or earn camels (money).&#10;&#10;Phase 3: Players spend money/camels on various investments.&#10;&#10;A player either goes for one-time bonuses from the nobles of Assur, or makes long-term investments by offerings to gods and building Ziggurats.&#10;&#10;The game lasts for three eras, made up of 2-3 of such cycles. After each era comes the flood: the board is partially cleaned up, but players also capitalize on their investments from phase 3. Each round, players also score points for huts (those built on fertile land between the two rivers bring more points) and ziggurat tiles.&#10;&#10;In comparison to other games from Ystari's series - Assyria is lighter than Caylus, Olympos, Ys or Sylla (in terms of complexity, available choices - represented by numerous tiles, cards, icons, cards etc. that need to be remembered and can be combined during play), but heavier than Yspahan, Mykerinos or Metropolis.&#10;&#10;";4;90;12;2;45;Assyria;90;2009;Arnaud Demaegd;Ancient,Civilization;Emanuele Ornella;Ystari originals;Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Hand Management,Worker Placement;Rio Grande Games,Ystari Games;6.915780000000002;1371;assyria;94;0.0;0.0;3.0;0;0.54;tJWHrpk28I;False;0;4.0;90.0;12.0;2.0;45.0;Assyria;7;2-4;17;45-90;27.45;0.0;51.99;44.73;225;2009.0;assyria

524;6309;47185;"Warhammer: Invasion The Card Game is a two-player card game of intense warfare, clever kingdom management, and epic questing. Players must carefully allocate their resources as they seek to build their kingdom, complete quests, and attack the enemy&rsquo;s capital.&#10;&#10;Set in the rich and diverse Warhammer universe, player's can choose different factions that each have their own style. Will you play the indestructible grudge-bearing Dwarfs, the shrewd and manoeuvrable Empire, the savage and destructive Orcs, or the entropic and mutating forces of Chaos. Or will you cleverly craft an alliance, playing the combined might of the forces of either Order or Destruction?&#10;&#10;Warhammer: Invasion follows a similar model to that of Magic: The Gathering. Players will construct a deck of cards to their liking that they will use to battle against each other by drawing cards and using resources to play them. Cards can consist of monsters or heroes, one-off spells or abilities, and permanent structures, devices, or equipment. However, there are many differences which make W:I very different from Magic. Two of the main differences are in the release model and the ordering of the gameplay area.&#10;&#10;Rather than a blind collecting model, W:I follows Fantasy Flight Games' LCG model. Each expansion or chapter pack is released with the full contents known to the purchaser. Rarity is not a factor.&#10;&#10;Rather than playing your cards into the same area and relying on card draws for resources or extra cards, each player has a 3-zoneCapitol that they must protect and those sides are generally where cards are played. If an opponent causes enough damage to a section of your capitol it is &quot;burned.&quot; If two sides of your capitol are burned you lose. Depending on which side of your capitol you put a card into it will be able to different things. Units and buildings in the Kingdom Zone contribute to your available resource pool while ones in your Quest Zone cotribute to your card draws. Cards played into the Battlefield are used to attack opponents. Also, units in a zone being attacked by an opponent can be used to defend that zone from damage. This adds a large amount of tactical decisions when it comes to playing your cards. You must carefully balance building your economy with the ability to attack and defend.&#10;&#10;Warhammer Invasion LCG Core Set contains:&#10;&#10;* 1 Rulebook&#10;    * 220 Cards representing 4 factions&#10;    * 4 Capital Boards&#10;    * 35 Resource Tokens&#10;    * 60 Damage Tokens&#10;    * 4 Burning Tokens&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Battle Pack Expansion Cycles:&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;        &#10;1) The Corruption Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Skavenblight Threat&#10;    Path of the Zealot&#10;    Tooth and Claw&#10;    The Deathmaster's Dance&#10;    The Warpstone Chronicles&#10;    Arcane Fire&#10;&#10;&#10;2) The Enemy Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Burning of Derricksburg&#10;    The Fall of Karak Grimaz&#10;    The Silent Forge&#10;    Redemption of a Mage&#10;    The Fourth Waystone&#10;    Bleeding Sun&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;3) The Morrslieb Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Omens of Ruin&#10;    The Chaos Moon&#10;    The Twin Tailed Comet&#10;    Signs in the Stars&#10;    The Eclipse of Hope&#10;    Fiery Dawn&#10;&#10;&#10;4) The Capital Cycle:&#10;&#10;    The Inevitable City&#10;    Realm of the Phoenix King&#10;    The Iron Rock&#10;    Karaz-a-Karak&#10;    City of Winter&#10;    The Imperial Throne&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;5) The Bloodquest Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Rising Dawn&#10;    Fragments of Power&#10;    The Accursed Dead&#10;    Vessel of the Winds&#10;    Portent of Doom&#10;    Shield of the Gods&#10;&#10;&#10;6) The Eternal War Cycle:&#10;&#10;    Days of Blood&#10;    Oaths of Vengeance&#10;    Battle for the Old World&#10;    Glory of Days Past&#10;    The Ruinous Hordes&#10;    Faith and Steel          &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;        &#10;7) Deluxe Expansions:&#10;&#10;    Assault on Ulthuan&#10;    March of the Damned&#10;    Legends&#10;    Cataclysm&#10;    Hidden Kingdoms&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;";2;45;13;2;45;Warhammer: Invasion;45;2009;Kevin Childress,Paul Dainton,Andrew Navaro,Brian Schomburg,Adrian Smith,WiL Springer;Card Game,Collectible Components,Fantasy,Fighting,Mythology;Eric M.

This new planet will be harsh, but if you have the skills to manage your resources, build a fleet, research alien life, and settle colonies, the world can be yours.&#10;&#10;Alien Frontiers is a game of resource management and planetary development for two to four players. During the game you will utilize orbital facilities and alien technology to build colony domes in strategic locations to control the newly discovered world.&#10;&#10;The game board shows the planet, its moon, the stations in orbit around the planet, and the solar system&rsquo;s star. The dice you are given at the start of the game represent the space ships in your fleet. You will assign these ships to the orbital facilities in order to earn resources, expand your fleet, and colonize the planet.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, you will place your colony tokens on the planet to represent the amount of control you have over each territory. Those territories exert influence over specific orbital facilities and, if you control a territory, you are able to utilize that sway to your advantage.&#10;&#10;The planet was once the home of an alien race and they left behind a wondrous artifact in orbit. Using your fleet to explore the artifact, you will discover amazing alien technologies that you can use to advance your cause.&#10;&#10;Winning the game will require careful consideration as you assign your fleet, integrate the alien technology and territory influences into your expansion plans, and block your opponents from building colonies of their own. Do you have what it takes to conquer an alien frontier?&#10;&#10;Roll and place your dice to gain advantages over your opponent and block them out of useful areas of the board.  Use Alien Tech cards to manipulate your dice rolls and territory bonuses to break the rules.  Steal resources, overtake territories, and do whatever it takes to get your colonies on the map first!  Don't dream it'll be easy, though, because the other players will be trying to do the same thing.&#10;&#10;";4;90;13;2;90;Alien Frontiers;90;2010;Piotr Burzykowski,Karim Chakroun,Mark Maxwell;Dice,Science Fiction;Tory Niemann;Aliens,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Crowdfunding: ulule;Area Control / Area Influence,Card Drafting,Dice Rolling,Worker Placement;Clever Mojo Games,Game Salute,LocWorks;7.496869999999999;11327;alien frontiers;19;2.0;3.0;3.5908076923076964;0;0.2;cODAEDHx5x;False;0;4.0;90.0;13.0;2.0;90.0;Alien Frontiers;169;2-4;698;90;60.0;80.0;8.49;0.0;1236;2010.0;alien frontiers

527;6325;50381;"&quot;A party game for horrible people.&quot;&#10;&#10;Play begins with a judge, known as the &quot;Card Czar&quot;, choosing a black question or fill-in-the-blank card from the top of the deck and showing it to all players.  Each player holds a hand of ten white answer cards at the beginning of each round, and passes a card (sometimes two) to the Card Czar, face-down, representing their answer to the question on the card. The card czar determines which answer card(s) are funniest in the context of the question or fill-in-the-blank card. The player who submitted the chosen card(s) is given the question card to represent an &quot;Awesome Point&quot;, and then the player to the left of the new Card Czar becomes the new Czar for the next round. Play continues until the players agree to stop, at which point the player with the most Awesome Points is the winner.&#10;&#10;This, so far, sounds like the popular and fairly inoffensive Apples to Apples. While the games are similar, the sense of humor required is very different. The game encourages players to poke fun at practically every awkward or taboo subject including race, religion, gender, poverty, torture, alcoholism, drugs, sex (oh yes), abortion, child abuse, celebrities, and those everyday little annoyances like &quot;Expecting a burp and vomiting on the floor&quot;.&#10;&#10;In addition, there are a few extra rules.  First, some question cards are &quot;Pick 2&quot; or cards, which require each participant to submit two cards in sequence to complete their answer. Second, a gambling component also exists.  If a question is played which a player believes they have two possible winning answers for, they may bet an Awesome Point to play a single second answer.  If the player who gambled wins, they retain the wagered point, but if they lose, the player who contributed the winning answer takes both points.&#10;&#10;From the website:&#10;&#10;&quot;Cards Against Humanity is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-Share Alike license - that means you can use and remix the game for free, but you can't sell it.

529;6353;53953;"For ages the vile Doom Knights have sought to gather the remaining Thunderstones to fulfill a prophecy of corruption over the lands. Now the first Thunderstone has been discovered in the Dungeons of Grimhold and the Doom Knights have sent their minions to claim the relic. The Villagers of Barrowsdale gather brave souls to face the dungeon and keep the Thunderstone out of the hands of the Doom Knights.&#10;&#10;Thunderstone is a fantasy deck-building game much in the style of Dominion. Before the game starts a selection of Village and Hero cards will be randomnly chosen that players may add to their specific decks. Like Dominion, every player starts with a basic deck of weaker cards that they can use to purchase other more powerful cards. In Thunderstone these cards may be different Heroes such as mages, archers, thieves, or warriors or they may be supplies the heroes need like weapons, rations, or light to reach further into the dungeon.&#10;&#10;A dungeon deck is also created by combining several different groups of monsters. Certain groups of monsters may be more or less susceptible to different Hero types, so players will have to take this into account when they choose what to buy.&#10;&#10;Rather than buying puny Victory Points, players will use their deck to defeat monsters in the dungeon. From the monster deck a row of cards is laid out. Players may on their turn choose to attack a monster in the deck rather than visit town and buy cards. If they do this they play cards from their hand and resolve their abilities in order to boost strength and have enough light to reach a specific monster. Some monsters also have special abilities which may hinder the player. If they have enough strength they defeat the monster and place that card in their deck. This card is worth victory points and often can be used as money to purchase other cards. In addition to this, players are awarded experience points for defeating monsters which can be used to upgrade their heroes into more powerful versions. The game is played until the Thunderstone is revealed from the dungeon and a player is able to claim it. The player with the most victory points in their deck is the winner.&#10;&#10;The basic Thunderstone framework was updated in the implementation of Thunderstone: Advance.&#10;&#10;Integrates with&#10;&#10;&#10;    Thunderstone Advance: Towers of Ruin&#10;    Thunderstone: Dragonspire&#10;    Thunderstone: Starter Set&#10;&#10;&#10;";5;60;12;1;60;Thunderstone;60;2009;Jason Engle;Card Game,Fantasy,Fighting;Mike Elliott;Solitaire Games,Thunderstone;Card Drafting,Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management;Alderac Entertainment Group (AEG),Arclight,Edge Entertainment,Hobby World,Pegasus Spiele,REBEL.pl,Stratelibri,Wargames Club Publishing;7.00858;8993;thunderstone;6;0.0;0.0;3.211486486486488;0;0.21;p4FQtHbX85;True;0;5.0;80.0;14.0;2.0;45.0;Thunderstone;74;2-5;235;45-80;54.99;0.0;0.0;0.0;277;2009.0;thunderstone

As control of a government can change with each new investment, players may control several governments at the same time.

Gameplay is similar to standard Clue, with special &quot;intrigue cards&quot; new to the game.&#10;&#10;Intrigue cards come in two varieties: Clocks and Keepers.  They are obtained in one of three ways: rolling a question mark on the included custome dice, landing on a question mark on the board, or if your character is moved to a room as part of someone starting a rumor (equivalent to Clue's &quot;making a suggestion.&quot;)  The first two situations incur a forced draw, while the third is optional.  There are eight clock cards in the intrigue deck, and if you draw the eighth card then you automatically lose.  Keepers give a one-time bonus that allow you to slightly alter some of the game's parameters...risk of drawing a clock; potential reward of benefiting from a keeper.&#10;&#10;Additionally, each of the six characters have a &quot;personality card&quot; which alows for a one-time power.

During the hunt, you'll encounter a series of stories in a &quot;choose your own adventure&quot; style journey through various events and encounters.  Finally, when you meet the monster you're pursuing, you'll engage it in an a massive arena-style battle where only one party is going to survive.

541;6442;57163;"Description from BoardgameNews.com:&#10;&#10;The Gonzaga family ruled part of northern Italy for nearly five hundred years, losing control to the Hapsburgs from Austria in 1708. During their reign, two daughters of the House of Gonzaga married Holy Roman Emperors. In Gonzaga, players must get into the expansionist spirit of the times and build fiefdoms across Europe to stake a claim on harbors and cities, while also trying to complete secret missions. The game lasts 7-12 rounds, and players are competing in some of six regions in Europe. (The number of regions and the specific regions vary based on the number of players and the scenario tile drawn at the start of the game.)&#10;&#10;A round starts with each player drawing a fief card from their individual deck; each fief card depicts one of twelve fiefs: plastic components comprising multiple hexagonal loops with castles on some of these loops. Each player then secretly chooses both a region card and an action card, then reveals them simultaneously. Part of the fief (but not all of it) must lie in the chosen region, and the action card determines whether a player must play the fief on one or more harbors, on one or more cities, on open land, or on both harbors and cities. With this last action &ndash; the alliance card &ndash; a player can alternatively place one or two of six individual rings on the board, even on spaces that another player has already claimed with a fief. You score points for covering cities and harbors, for connecting at least three harbors in a sea, and for setting aside your fief as a donation to the church. The cards you play are set aside for the next turn, thereby forcing you to switch regions and actions as you place fiefs.&#10;&#10;The game ends either after twelve rounds or after a trigger point based on the cities and harbors not covered. The player with the most connected fiefs, including the individual rings, scores a bonus, then players reveal their hidden objectives and score based on the number of target cities they covered.&#10;&#10;";4;60;8;2;30;Gonzaga;60;2009;Alberto Bontempi,Stefano de Fazi;Age of Reason,City Building,Renaissance;Guglielmo Duccoli;;Area Control / Area Influence,Hand Management,Route/Network Building,Simultaneous Action Selection,Tile Placement;ABACUSSPIELE,dV Giochi;6.60849;756;gonzaga;11;0.0;0.0;3.2142857142857144;0;0.0;pjFBD7HzyX;False;0;4.0;60.0;8.0;2.0;30.0;Gonzaga;14;2-4;43;30-60;0.0;49.99;0.0;49.99;120;2009.0;gonzaga

As with the standard version of this game, one can win a military victory, either as Sauron and the Shadow Armies if he conquers a certain number of Free People cities and strongholds, or with similar conditions when playing as Fellowship and Free People. The game may also be won by the Free People by completing the quest of the Ringbearer and trying to get secretly to Mount Doom to destroy the One Ring. Hidden movement prevents Sauron's awareness of the real intention of his enemies and keeps him looking across Middle Earth for the precious Ring. The Free People player must balance the need to protect the Ringbearer from harm, against the attempt to raise a proper defense against the armies of the Shadow, so that they do not overrun Middle Earth before the Ringbearer completes his quest.&#10;&#10;Limited and different choices are offered each turn through the roll of action dice which dictate the type of actions may be performed.  The choices range from personal character actions to political and military decisions through which to develop your winning strategies.&#10;&#10;The War of the Ring Collector's Edition brings all that was in the base game and introduces factions, new characters and new events from the expansion, including Galadriel, the Balrog, the Ents, Dunlendings, Siege Towers, Catapults, Corsairs, and more. It is a complete game with updates to the original game rules and incorporates the expansion rules and cards to allow for new strategies to play out.  This increases both the offensive options of the Shadow Forces and defensive options of the Free Peoples.  This all-in-one version of the game is deeper, more comprehensive, and offers both more, and more difficult, choices of what path to pursue to victory, and where to spend one&rsquo;s resources.

So you have five dice for each of the speeds and two of &quot;gas&quot; to continue moving without changing your speed. Each die is playable exactly once each turn.

547;6520;62219;"Game Overview&#10;90,000 B.C. &mdash; A great ice age is fast approaching. Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the varying animal species. &#10;Dominant Species is a game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous encroachment of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth. &#10;Each player will assume the role of one of six major animal classes&mdash;mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid, or insect. Each begins the game more or less in a state of natural balance in relation to one another. But that won&rsquo;t last: It is indeed &quot;survival of the fittest&quot;.&#10;Through wily action pawn placement, players will strive to become dominant on as many different terrain tiles as possible in order to claim powerful card effects. Players will also want to propagate their individual species in order to earn victory points for their particular animal. Players will be aided in these endeavors via speciation, migration, and adaptation actions, among others. &#10;All of this eventually leads to the end game&mdash;the final ascent of the ice age&mdash;where the player having accumulated the most victory points will have his animal crowned the Dominant Species. &#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly, because it&rsquo;s getting mighty cold...&#10;&#10;Game Play&#10;The large hexagonal tiles are used throughout the game to create an ever-expanding interpretation of earth as it might have appeared a thousand centuries ago. The smaller tundra tiles will be placed atop the larger tiles&mdash;converting them into tundra in the process&mdash;as the ice age encroaches.&#10;The cylindrical action pawns (or &quot;AP&quot;s) drive the game. Each AP will allow a player to perform the various actions that can be taken, such as speciation, environmental change, migration, or glaciation. After being placed on the action display during the Planning Phase, an AP will trigger that particular action for the owning player during the Execution Phase.&#10;Generally, players will be trying to enhance their own animal&rsquo;s survivability while simultaneously trying to hinder that of their opponents&rsquo;&mdash;hopefully collecting valuable victory points (or &quot;VP&quot;s) along the way. The various cards will aid in these efforts, giving players useful one-time abilities or an opportunity for recurring VP gains.&#10;Throughout the game, species cubes will be added to, moved about in, and removed from the tiles in play (the &quot;earth&quot;). Element disks will be added to and removed from both animals and earth. &#10;When the game ends, players will conduct a final scoring of each tile&mdash;after which the player controlling the animal with the highest VP total wins the game.&#10;&#10;Reimplemented by&#10;&#10;    Dominant Species: The Card Game&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";6;240;14;2;120;Dominant Species;240;2010;Chad Jensen,Rodger B.

The cards are numbered 1-100, and each card has a number of bullheads on it. Each player starts with ten cards in hand and is trying to discard those cards to win the round. The player who goes out scores zero points, while everyone else loses points equal to the number of bullheads on their cards.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing cards on multiple rows, however, players play onto a single discard stack, with the played card being higher than the top card of the stack but not more than ten higher; if you can&rsquo;t play a card within this ten point range, you have to pick up the discard pile. Ergo, &quot;11 takes&quot;. You then start two new stacks by revealing cards from the top of the deck. The number of piles keeps growing throughout the game.&#10;&#10;Each time you take a stack with more than three cards, you get a bull card. For each bull card you have, you can play an additional card on your turn as long as all the cards fall within that ten point spread.&#10;&#10;";7;30;8;2;30;11 nimmt!;30;2010;Oliver Freudenreich;Card Game;Wolfgang Kramer;6 nimmt!,Animals: Cattle;Hand Management;999 Games,AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH,Asmodee,Mercurio;6.27933;1078;11 nimmt!;31;0.0;0.0;3.466666666666667;0;0.0;Ak8TRq1A6X;False;0;7.0;30.0;8.0;2.0;30.0;11 nimmt!;15;2-7;134;30;20.26;24.99;0.0;0.0;275;2010.0;11 nimmt!
554;6556;63759;"Seeland plays in the golden era of the Netherlands (17th century). In this time the province Seeland (Zeeland) gains ever more power, prosperity and significance. The object of the game is to expand and extract more land surface from the sea. Players live as a respected burgher in this time and take part in the land reclamation.&#10;&#10;The game board shows 3 main sections - the scoring track around the edge, a rondel where you gather seed tiles and windmill tiles, and the land area where you place and/or reveal tiles for scoring. Setup includes randomly placing &quot;island&quot; tiles on spaces designated in the land area. At the beginning of the game, you place one of your 4 windmill pawns in the special starting area indicated in approximately the center of the land area.&#10;&#10;The rondel uses a unique method for determining which tiles are available in the inner ring of the market. If you select a seed tile, (cabbage, rapeseed, or tulips) you must place it on an empty space adjacent to one of your windmill pawns. If you choose a windmill tile, you place it on an empty space adjacent to a space already containing a tile. All tiles have a victory point number (some are zero). When you surround a windmill, you total the adjacent tiles and score that amount on the track, if you have at least 2 types of seed amongst the adjacent tiles. If all tiles are of the same type, no points are scored. If all 3 types are present, add 5 points to the total.&#10;&#10;If you place a windmill next to one or more island tiles, you flip them over to reveal their type. They may be seeds or a farm. If you reveal a farm, you get a coin which can be used to take an immediate second turn.&#10;&#10;When either the supply of windmill tiles or of seed tiles is exhausted, the game will soon end. (The exact end time depends on the movement within the rondel.)&#10;&#10;If you are playing with the set of rules that allow for end game bonus points, score them, and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";4;60;9;2;45;Seeland;60;2010;Franz Vohwinkel;Economic,Farming;Günter Burkhardt,Wolfgang Kramer;Country: The Netherlands;Tile Placement;Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH;6.9598;1445;seeland;59;0.0;0.0;3.1129032258064515;0;0.0;qJb1qIM8R6;True;0;4.0;60.0;9.0;2.0;45.0;Seeland;31;2-4;106;45-60;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;206;2010.0;seeland

557;6584;65244;"Forbidden Island is a visually stunning cooperative board game. Instead of winning by competing with other players like most games, everyone must work together to win the game. Players take turns moving their pawns around the 'island', which is built by arranging the many beautifully screen-printed tiles before play begins. As the game progresses, more and more island tiles sink, becoming unavailable, and the pace increases. Players use strategies to keep the island from sinking, while trying to collect treasures and items. As the water level rises, it gets more difficult- sacrifices must be made.&#10;&#10;What causes this game to truly stand out among co-op and competitive games alike is the extreme detail that has been paid to the physical components of the game. It comes in a sturdy and organized tin of good shelf storage size. The plastic treasure pieces and wooden pawns are well crafted and they fit just right into the box. The cards are durable, well printed, and easy to understand. The island tiles are the real gem: they are screen-printed with vibrant colors, each with a unique and pleasing image.&#10;&#10;With multiple levels of difficulty, different characters to choose from (each with a special ability of their own), many optional island formats and game variations available, Forbidden Island has huge replay value. The game can be played by as few as two players and up to four (though it can accommodate five). More players translates into a faster and more difficult game, though the extra help can make all the difference. This is a fun game, tricky for players of almost any age. Selling for under twenty dollars, oddly, Forbidden Island is a rare game of both quality and affordable price.&#10; For those who enjoy Forbidden Island, a follow-up project by Gamewright titled Forbidden Desert was released in 2013.&#10;&#10;From the publisher's website:&#10;&#10;Dare to discover Forbidden Island!

561;6608;65781;"London was Treefrog's 2010 Essen release.&#10;&#10;(Inspired by the history of the city from just after the Great Fire until 1900, the game has evolved since the description originally listed on the Treefrog website).&#10;&#10;London is a 2-4 player game with a playing time of aproximately 90 minutes.  Players select cards with varying powers of cashflow, victory points, and poverty penalties, and compete to manage them most efficiently.&#10;&#10;&quot;London lies devastated after the Great Fire of 1666. This is your opportunity to build a new city on the ashes of the old. It is up to you how you employ the talents of the people of London to this end. Will you favour the business classes, who will earn you money? Or would you prefer to spend more money than you can rightly afford on grand monuments and sumptuous palaces? You must also deal with the problem of rising poverty and how to employ the many paupers of the city. Throughout the game you will be forced to make tough decisions. To achieve one aim you must sacrifice another, which may open an opportunity for a competitor.&quot;&#10;&#10;Nearly 250 years of progress is glimpsed in this game. Famous buildings and monuments of the era as well as engineering developments such as streetlights are illustrated on the cards.&#10;&#10;The publisher calls London &quot;a relatively simple game that can be played easily within ninety minutes.&quot;&#10;&#10;Description below is quoted from Kris Hall's BGN interview with Martin Wallace:&#10;http://www.boardgamenews.com/index.php/boardgamenews/comments/kris_hall_the_martin_wallace_2010_preview_interview &#10;(Note: Some elements of the game described below have changed as shown in the final rulebook available online)&#10;&#10;As with a lot of games, London is about scoring the most VPs.  Players manage their hand, selecting cards to play into their building display by laying them out in a line.  At some point a player will choose to run his city. They can activate their buildings in whatever order they prefer.  The resulting actions can generate money and VPs, reduce poverty or have some other effect specified on the card.  Some cards have an entry cost which must be paid before the action can be performed.&#10;&#10;";4;90;13;2;90;London;90;2010;Mike Atkinson,Peter Dennis,Simon Jannerland;City Building,Economic;Martin Wallace;Cities: London,Country: England,Tableau Building,Treefrog Line;Card Drafting,Hand Management;Mayfair Games,Osprey Games,Treefrog Games;7.41782;5503;london;55;0.0;0.0;3.504838709677419;0;0.0;Vt2Gio0w94;False;0;4.0;90.0;14.0;2.0;60.0;London;62;2-4;248;60-90;119.99;0.0;0.0;0.0;314;2010.0;london

Players invest in the production of raw materials, the manufacture of goods, and the transportation networks needed to connect them to their markets.&#10;&#10;Like Brass, the strategic space is vast, and player decisions are limited by cards. In Age of Industry, however, cards are color-coded to regions rather than specific cities, allowing the players to be more flexible with their plans, while at the same time continuing to limit the decisions available. The color-coded region cards will also support expansion maps.&#10;&#10;In addition, the original Brass rules were simplified by eliminating the canal period; there is only one period, the railway era. There is also a new, non-specific industry, which will change with each map.&#10;&#10;According to Wallace, &quot;You can now play something with the depth of Brass, but in half the time.

Dragons are searching for treasure, of course, but they're being pursued by dragon hunters, and those are the two sides that face off in this game.

By laying out cards, a player collects point cards that are already present.

Points are scored mostly by painting the fresco, which requires specific combinations of paints, so you'll need to buy and mix your paints wisely, in addition to beating other players to the paints and fresco segments you would like to paint.&#10;&#10;Fresco includes several expansion modules, so you can play without expansions for a lighter family game or add in expansions to vary play and increase the decision-making and difficulty, resulting in a very flexible game with a high replay value.&#10;&#10;";4;60;10;2;60;Fresco;60;2010;Oliver Schlemmer;Renaissance;Wolfgang Panning,Marco Ruskowski,Marcel Süßelbeck;Queen Yellow Wave Box Series,Visual Arts: Painting;Action / Movement Programming,Set Collection,Simultaneous Action Selection,Worker Placement;Queen Games,Arclight,Competo / Marektoy,Piatnik;7.3372600000000014;8819;fresco;4;2.0;3.0;3.6260273972602737;0;0.2;dvU5WLnT5n;False;0;4.0;60.0;10.0;2.0;60.0;Fresco;146;2-4;395;60;47.99;0.0;51.95;0.0;777;2010.0;fresco

A cave mouth leads to a maze of tunnels and chambers, and deep within this monster-infested labyrinth lurks the most terrifying creature of all: a red dragon!&#10;&#10;Designed for 1-5 players, this boardgame features multiple scenarios, challenging quests, and cooperative game play.&#10;&#10;Each player selects a hero; a rogue, thief, warrior, cleric, or wizard.

Slain monsters reward the players with treasure, and experience points, allowing them to level up and increase their skills during play.

575;6720;68448;"You are the leader of one of the 7 great cities of the Ancient World. Gather resources, develop commercial routes, and affirm your military supremacy. Build your city and erect an architectural wonder which will transcend future times.&#10;&#10;7 Wonders lasts three ages. In each age, players receive seven cards from a particular deck, choose one of those cards, then pass the remainder to an adjacent player. Players reveal their cards simultaneously, paying resources if needed or collecting resources or interacting with other players in various ways. (Players have individual boards with special powers on which to organize their cards, and the boards are double-sided). Each player then chooses another card from the deck they were passed, and the process repeats until players have six cards in play from that age. After three ages, the game ends.&#10;&#10;In essence, 7 Wonders is a card development game. Some cards have immediate effects, while others provide bonuses or upgrades later in the game. Some cards provide discounts on future purchases. Some provide military strength to overpower your neighbors and others give nothing but victory points. Each card is played immediately after being drafted, so you'll know which cards your neighbor is receiving and how his choices might affect what you've already built up. Cards are passed left-right-left over the three ages, so you need to keep an eye on the neighbors in both directions.&#10;&#10;Though the box of earlier editions is listed as being for 3&ndash;7 players, there is an official 2-player variant included in the instructions.&#10;&#10;";7;30;10;2;30;7 Wonders;30;2010;Miguel Coimbra;Ancient,Card Game,City Building,Civilization;Antoine Bauza;7 Wonders,Tableau Building;Card Drafting,Hand Management,Set Collection,Simultaneous Action Selection,Variable Player Powers;Repos Production,ADC Blackfire Entertainment,Asmodee,Asterion Press,Galápagos Jogos,Gém Klub Kft.,Hobby Japan,Kaissa Chess & Games,Lautapelit.fi,Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd,REBEL.pl;7.83595;51688;7 wonders;1;2.75;2.583333333333333;3.8598518518518503;0;0.2;OF145SrX44;False;0;7.0;45.0;10.0;2.0;30.0;7 Wonders;810;2-7;8074;30-45;39.95;74.99;0.0;0.0;5124;2010.0;7 wonders

The end goal is simple enough, the player who has the most Victory Points at the end of the game wins! Players acquire Victory Points by employing a variety of maids and &quot;Love&quot; cards that allow for different strategies. You can even employ Private Maids that stick around to use their special powers each per turn! Some give you a bonus, or affect your opponents in a negative way. But beware, your opponents can make your maids sick or give them bad habits, affecting your maids in negative ways and decreasing your Victory Points!&#10;&#10;The game art is in the Japanese anime style and uses the theme of maids commonly seen in anime!

578;6756;70149;"In Ora et Labora, each player is head of a monastery in the Medieval era who acquires land and constructs buildings &ndash; little enterprises that will gain resources and profit. The goal is to build a working infrastructure and manufacture prestigious items &ndash; such as books, ceramics, ornaments, and relics &ndash; to gain the most victory points at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Ora et Labora, Uwe Rosenberg's fifth &quot;big&quot; game, has game play mechanisms similar to his Le Havre, such as two-sided resource tiles that can be upgraded from a basic item to something more useful. Instead of adding resources to the board turn by turn as in Agricola and Le Havre, Ora et Labora uses a numbered rondel to show how many of each resource is available at any time. At the beginning of each round, players turn the rondel by one segment, adjusting the counts of all resources at the same time.&#10;&#10;Each player has a personal game board. New buildings enter the game from time to time, and players can construct them on their game boards with the building materials they gather, with some terrain restrictions on what can be built where. Some spaces start with trees or moors on them, as in Agricola: Farmers of the Moor, so they hinder development until a player clears the land, but they provide resources when they are removed. Clever building on your personal game board will impact your final score, and players can buy additional terrain during the game, if needed.&#10;&#10;Players also have three workers who can enter buildings to take the action associated with that location. Workers must stay in place until you've placed all three. You can enter your own buildings with these workers, but to enter and use another player's buildings, you must pay that player an entry fee so that he'll move one of his workers into that building to do the work for you.&#10;&#10;Ora et Labora features two variants: France and Ireland.&#10;&#10;";4;180;13;1;60;Ora et Labora;180;2011;Klemens Franz;City Building,Economic,Industry / Manufacturing,Medieval,Religious,Territory Building;Uwe Rosenberg;Beer,Country: France,Country: Ireland,Harvest Series,Solitaire Games,Tableau Building,Wine Games;Modular Board,Pattern Building,Set Collection,Tile Placement,Worker Placement;Lookout Games,999 Games,Filosofia Éditions,Game Harbor,Hobby Japan,HomoLudicus,Lacerta,uplay.it edizioni,Z-Man Games;7.78424;7516;ora et labora;32;3.0;3.0;3.791250000000001;0;-1.14;NbD7rJP2qz;False;12;4.0;180.0;13.0;1.0;60.0;Ora et Labora;92;1-4;279;60-180;149.99;99.95;62.67;0.0;1669;2011.0;ora et labora

580;6763;70512;"&quot;The end of her regency is nigh. It's time to clear the way for a new bearer of the burden. She will keep a wary eye on the novices representing their Orders and trying to win her favor. Eventually, she will have to come to a decision. Which Order will prove itself worthy to decide on her successor? There will be a new Moon Priestess and she will bear the title: LUNA.&quot;&#10;&#10;&quot;LUNA&quot; is the title of the Moon Priestess, and before her very eyes, each of the up to four Orders competes for the right to decide on her successor. The players are the heads of the Orders who try to convince the Priestess of themselves. Over the course of six rounds, they need to collect as many influence points as possible by skillfully placing their novices to achieve that goal.&#10;&#10;The players move their novices over seven islands surrounding a temple island. The novices are placed according to the &quot;worker movement&quot; principle, i.e. they aren't placed at the beginning of a round, but instead start where they ended the round before. Thus, novice movement is an important part of a round: Only if you're in the right place at the right time, you'll gain the deciding influence points. You'll have to build new shrines, work at the temple, and participate in the Priestess' divine services. But don't forget to recruit additional novices or win the favor of the local Priests; these are vital means to prepare and combine the diverse actions.&#10;&#10;LUNA: In the Domain of the Moon Priestess is a challenging tactical game with strategic and interactive elements that takes about 20-25 minutes per player. The different placement of the islands and novices at the beginning of the game creates a different feeling each time you play and opens up new strategies.&#10;&#10;";4;100;12;1;60;Luna;100;2010;Klemens Franz;Fantasy,Religious;Stefan Feld;Solitaire Games;Area Control / Area Influence,Modular Board,Point to Point Movement,Tile Placement,Worker Placement;Hall Games,Pegasus Spiele,Tasty Minstrel Games,Z-Man Games;7.402369999999999;3243;luna;89;0.0;0.0;3.893445322793149;0;-2.01;WabPfVLtwx;False;0;4.0;100.0;12.0;1.0;60.0;Luna;66;1-4;112;60-100;180.3;0.0;56.99;0.0;611;2010.0;luna

You&rsquo;ll need everything you can get; you'll have a small amount of resources and time, and you must grab the latest hot show before your opponents.&#10;&#10;And some Stars will give their best effort only if you put them on in the proper conditions. For example, some Stars only want to be put on dramas. Other Stars want to be the only Star on the show.

The game is played over 4 rounds (years), during which you will be acquiring the pieces for your towers and assembling them.&#10;&#10;Players are given a hand of cards with different colors.  On their turn, players play a card from their hand to an action space on the board.

Turns continue around the table until all players are out of cards for that round.&#10;     &#10;Scoring happens at the end of each round based on the number of towers a player has and the ornamentation present on those towers.

Five... Four... Three...&#10;&#10;The Thing is an unauthorised non-collectable, non-profit game for two to six players, based on the 1982 horror movie masterpiece &quot;John Carpenter's The Thing&quot;, and simulates the paranoid members of an American Antarctic research facility (Outpost 31) being overrun by - or conquering - a parasitic alien organism capable of perfectly imitating its victims. One player begins as the Thing - all the other players start as human.&#10;&#10;The game is primarily played out using six asymmetrical card decks - three decks for each side (each deck corresponds to a different section of the narrative). Managing your hand of cards, and when to use each deck, is key to winning the game.&#10;&#10;The twelve members of the Outpost 31 team cards are positioned between the players, with each human player taking one character. The team then have to overcome various encounters, while trying to stay alive, in an effort to stop the Thing. Encounters are directly taken from film events, and are sorted into three separate acts - the second and third acts are shuffled, and then all three acts are placed together, forming one narrative (in this way, each game is a little different). Some example encounters: Autopsy of Norwegian-Thing, Battle in Dogtown, Explore Norwegian Base, Conduct Blood Test, and Investigate Crashed Saucer Site. In addition, the Outpost team must allocate men to tasks that may aid in their victory over the Thing. The truth being that the humans will not be able to achieve all that they want to do and will have to prioritise. All the while, the Thing player will do all in its power to thwart the human players, while attempting to construct its Blair-saucer in a secret ice cavern by cannibalising parts from the bulldozer, radio room, and helicopter.&#10;&#10;During the game, at various stages, the Thing player has the opportunity to place infection or dummy infection cards under the human character cards. Later in the game, the Thing may even directly infect other players (unbeknownst to the remaining players), or give the impression to the others that it has! The humans must keep their wits about them if they are to fight and win against the Thing, or they may find themselves fighting each other....&#10;&#10;Victory Conditions:&#10;&#10;1. The Outpost #31 team win if they survive the final confrontation, having destroyed the camp and sabotaged the Thing's Blair-saucer - and have killed all the Things.&#10;&#10;     If they are mistaken and some Things remain: the Things win.&#10;     If they killed a non-infected player: the Thing wins.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;2. The Thing wins if it completes construction of its Blair-saucer.&#10;3. The Thing wins if all the humans have been assimilated or killed.&#10;4.

599;6877;76436;"Avalon Hill's (AH) Bismarck 1979/80 edition, designed by Jack Greene, is a totally different game from the AH 1962 edition designed by Lindsley Schutz and Charles Roberts.&#10;&#10;The game centered around the hunt for the KMS Bismarck and the KMS Prinz Eugen in mid-1941. The game has some similarities to game Battleship, with both players having a hidden map-board and calling out coordinates to locate their opponent.&#10;&#10;There are two players, German and British. The British player has the arduous task of placing the large number of Royal Navy vessels and search aircraft on his map-board before game play begins. Each map-board is on a grid, with letters on one axis, and numbers on the other. Each Royal Navy unit has a historically accurate starting point. The German setup takes but a moment, since the Germans have only a few bomber units and the task force with Bismarck and Prinz Eugen to place on their map.&#10;&#10;Each turn, the players move their respective units (cardboard counters), searching for enemy units, and possibly engaging in combat. In the vast spaces of the Bering Sea and North Atlantic, the search phase becomes vital. Each player calls out grid coordinates containing a ship or aircraft, and the opponent indicates whether a ship is located there, and if so what type. A player may choose not to search with a particular unit, thus keeping its location secret (common tactic for German player, obviously). Since the Bismarck is the only enemy Battleship on the map, British discovery of her is key to victory. As the British are unlikely to have a force sufficient to sink the Bismarck when they initially find her, they will need to &quot;shadow&quot; the mighty vessel. A fast unit, such as the Heavy Cruiser Suffolk, is able to keep up with Bismarck and follow her on radar without engaging in combat.&#10;&#10;Eventually, British heavy units, such as the Battlecruiser Hood may be vectored into the same square as the German Task Force. At this point combat ensues. The British also have air units on the Aircraft Carriers Victorious and Ark Royal which can both search for the Germans and attack with torpedoes from a distance. The game has combat damage sheets with squares representing areas of each warship that can be damaged in combat. As combat is resolved, squares are checked off.&#10;&#10;The Germans win by avoiding contact with the British, successfully &quot;breaking out&quot; into the Atlantic and ravaging merchant shipping there. They can also achieve victory by destroying any opposition they encounter and making their way to a friendly port in occupied France. Historically, either scenario would have grave consequences for the Battle of the Atlantic. The British have a tougher task, needing to intercept and destroy the Germans. Since most British vessels are no match for Bismarck, it is necessary to vector several vessels currently on convoy escort duties in the area to form a powerful task force. Poor planning by the British or clever moves by the Germans allow Bismarck to slip through.&#10;&#10;The advanced rules of the game implement a weather system, combat using a miniatures-type system (with ship counters laid out on the floor), realistic damage to ships, etc. Alternate &quot;what if&quot; scenarios and ships are provided, such as the German Aircraft Carrier Graf Zeppelin, breakout with the Tirpitz and others. U-boats are also represented (albeit in an abstract way) in the Advanced game.&#10;&#10;Second edition changes included:&#10;&#10;     the square grid on the original map was replaced with a  hexagonal brick grid overlay;  &#10;     the single Bismarck ship unit was replaced by multiple German ships; &#10;     the relatively simple search, movement and combat systems of the original were replaced by much more complex rules. (Indeed, many considered the rules changes ponderous and detrimental to gameplay.)&#10;     packaging was modified, second edition coming in a smaller, standard-sized AH flat box (compared to the over-sized box of the first edition) and having alternative cover artwork.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";2;240;0;2;240;Bismarck (second edition);240;1980;Jean Baer,Claus Bergen,Bob Haynes,Mick (Mike) Uhl;Nautical,Wargame,World War II;Jack Greene;;Dice Rolling,Hex-and-Counter,Secret Unit Deployment,Simultaneous Action Selection;Avalon Hill;6.89182;132;bismarck (second edition);62;3.0;3.0;3.0;0;0.0;OHyQXWukWf;False;0;2.0;240.0;;2.0;240.0;Bismarck (second edition);1;2;2;240;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;21;1980.0;bismarck (second edition)

601;6898;77423;"The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is a cooperative adventure game in which the players attempt to complete a scenario, each with three heroes of their choice and a deck of allies, events and attachments to support them. Each round, players send their heroes and allies to quest or to fight with enemies that engage them. However, as the heroes and allies exhaust after questing, defending, or attacking, the players' options are typically insufficient to deal with everything at once. Therefore, players need to determine whether it is more urgent to quest and make progress in the scenario while the enemy forces gain power, or to take down enemies while making no progress, not knowing what will come next.&#10;&#10;The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game is the base game of a Living Card Game for which new adventure packs are released monthly. The base game contains three scenarios, twelve famous characters from the works of J.R.R. Tolkien (including Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli, Denethor and Eowyn), and four pre-constructed player decks. Players can either use one of these decks or construct their own deck to increase their chances to be succesful in the more challenging scenarios. The monthly adventure packs contain a new scenario, a new hero, and new player cards to be used in their deck. The base game is for 1-2 players, but with an additional base game the scenarios can be played with up to four players.&#10;&#10;Although this game is set in Tolkien's Middle Earth, the scenarios do not represent scenes from the books, but rather take place in the seventeen years from Bilbo's 111th birthday until Frodo's departure from the Shire.&#10;&#10;The scenarios from saga-expansions do represent scenes from the books. Saga-expansions will form the Campaign Mode so that you can play all the saga quests that deal with the trilogy (+ Hobbit) together in one marathon campaign.&#10;&#10;";2;60;13;1;60;The Lord of the Rings: The Card Game;60;2011;Even Mehl Amundsen,Erfian Asafat,Tiziano Baracchi,Ryan Barger,Sara Biddle,Yoann Boissonnet,Leonardo Borazio,Noah Bradley,Marco Caradonna,Kevin Childress,Anna Christenson,West Clendinning,Nicholas Cloister,Soul Core,Daarken,Katherine  Dinger,Empty Room Studios,Loren Fetterman,Tony Foti,Tom Garden,Kristina Gehrmann,Lucas Graciano,Margaret Hardy,Jeff Himmelman,David Horne,Ijur,Dominik Kasprzycki,Kaya,Igor Kieryluk,Mathias Kollros,Lius Lasahido,David Lecossu,Henning Ludvigsen,Daryl Mandryk,Mike Nash,David A.

For over one hundred and fifty years Britain and France were locked in a struggle for domination of North America. Thousands of miles from their homes, settlers and soldiers were faced with impenetrable forests, unpredictable American tribes, and formidable distances. Despite these obstacles they were able to engage in bitter warfare, with the British ultimately taking the prize of Quebec. A Few Acres of Snow is a two-player game that allows you to recreate this contest. You can change the course of history by your decisions.&#10;&#10;A Few Acres of Snow takes an innovative approach to the subject, using cards to represent locations and manpower. As the game progresses you add to your selection of cards, increasing the range of actions available to you. There are many strategies to be explored.

On-board systems have failed, plunging the ship into darkness. But even worse: A mysterious alien plague has crept aboard and is transforming the human crew into horrendous monsters! The remaining crewmen desperately try to save their lives by escaping from the derelict spaceship, but in the darkness the aliens are lurking...hungry for human flesh.&#10;&#10;The game is played on a hexagon-based map that represents the spaceship. Each player is given a map sheet and a pencil. Map sheets must be of the same zone, and every zone has its specific name. Starting from the first player and continuing clockwise, every turn, each player must make a movement. To do so, the player must write on their map sheet the coordinates of the sector to which they are moving. Every time the players move to the gray (dangerous) sectors they have to draw a card; these cards make the players tell the others their position or lie about it, depending on the card. Every card is kept secret from other players.&#10;&#10;The humans' objective is to save themselves using the escape hatches, while the aliens' objective is to hunt down the humans.

606;6969;83667;"During the second third of the 19th century, a rapid development of railway transport got under way. All over the world, the railway networks were growing and steam engines accelerated the progress. 175 years ago, on December 7 1835 to be precise, the first German train powered by a steam engine started operating between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth, transporting passengers and goods. In England&rsquo;s region of Wensleydale transport of goods via railway tracks was started 13 years later.&#10; First Train to Nuremberg is a revised edition of Last Train to Wensleydale. You take the role of a railway promoter, backed by the investments of hundreds of local landowners. Your aim is to build lines that can make a profit from the transport of passengers and goods. However, money is not the only resource you require. Many locals will oppose your schemes and only with influence in the government will you be able to build over their land. Your company is far too small to be able to have its own engine works, so contacts with the major operators will help you acquire second-hand trains and rolling stock. You will also need to be on good terms with the two local railway companies. Without their support you will not be able to link to their networks, nor will you be able to negotiate the sale of your lines when they become unprofitable (as they surely will).&#10;&#10;With First Train to Nuremberg now two players can fully enjoy this extraordinary train game as well. Instead of cheese and stone, now beer and mail will be transported, besides passengers of course. There is a new challenge when transporting passengers: They can travel first class now and thus you will gain more victory points but on the other hand, you have to buy trains that are more  expensive. Additionally, you may benefit from the first connection between Nuremberg and F&uuml;rth and receive extra victory points, which may be crucial for winning the game. What&rsquo;s more, you may play the original game of Last Train to Wensleydale on the flip side of the game board, or almost so. Some slight changes of the original rules work with that map as well as the rules of the first edition.&#10;&#10;";4;120;12;2;45;First Train to Nuremberg;120;2010;Dennis Lohausen;Trains,Transportation;Martin Wallace;Cities: Nürnberg,Country: England,Country: Germany;Auction/Bidding,Pick-up and Deliver,Route/Network Building,Set Collection;Argentum Verlag,Z-Man Games;7.15857;896;first train to nuremberg;65;0.0;0.0;3.5454545454545454;0;0.08;kgOka7LtVo;False;0;4.0;120.0;12.0;2.0;45.0;First Train To Nuremberg;11;2-4;31;45-120;50.38;0.0;45.95;0.0;223;2010.0;first train to nuremberg

608;6991;84876;"The game is set in the Burgundy region of High Medieval France. Each player takes on the role of an aristocrat, originally controlling a small princedom. While playing they aim to build settlements and powerful castles, practice trade along the river, exploit silver mines, and use the knowledge of travelers.&#10;&#10;The game is about players taking settlement tiles from the game board and placing them into their princedom which is represented by the player board. Every tile has a function that starts when the tile is placed in the princedom. The princedom itself consists of several regions, each of which demands its own type of settlement tile.&#10;&#10;The game is played in five phases, each consisting of five rounds.  Each phase begins with the game board stocked with settlement tiles and goods tiles.  At the beginning of each round all players roll their two dice, and the player who is currently first in turn order rolls a goods placement die.  A goods tile is made available on the game board according to the roll of the goods die.  During each round players take their turns in the current turn order.  During his turn, a player may perform any two of the four possible types of actions: 1) take a settlement tile from the numbered depot on the game board corresponding to one of his dice and place it in the staging area on his player board, 2) take a settlement tile from the staging area of his player board to a space on his player board with a number matching one of his dice in the corresponding region for the type of tile and adjacent to a previously placed settlement tile, 3) deliver goods with a number matching one of his dice, or 4) take worker tokens which allow the player to adjust the roll of his dice.  In addition to these actions a player may buy a settlement tile from the central depot on the game board and place it in the staging area on his player board.  If an action triggers the award of victory points, those points are immediately recorded.  Each settlement tile offers a benefit, additional actions, additional money, advancement on the turn order track, more goods tiles, die roll adjustment or victory points.  Bonus victory points are awarded for filling a region with settlement tiles.&#10;&#10;The game ends when the last player finishes his turn of the fifth round of the fifth phase.  Victory points are awarded for unused money and workers, and undelivered goods.  Bonus victory points from certain settlement tiles are awarded at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The player with the most victory points wins.&#10;&#10;The rules include basic and advanced versions.&#10;&#10;This game is #14 in the Alea big box series.&#10;&#10;";4;90;12;2;30;The Castles of Burgundy;90;2011;Julien Delval,Harald Lieske;Dice,Medieval,Territory Building;Stefan Feld;Alea Big Box,Country: France;Dice Rolling,Set Collection,Tile Placement,Variable Phase Order;alea,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH,Broadway Toys LTD,Hobby World;8.112119999999999;24876;the castles of burgundy;0;2.6;3.2;4.024496155862311;0;0.0;VNBC6yq1WO;False;9;4.0;90.0;12.0;2.0;30.0;The Castles of Burgundy;590;2-4;5169;30-90;41.99;0.0;13.49;0.0;6134;2011.0;the castles of burgundy

617;7077;89409;"BattleCON is a fast-paced head to head card game for 2 players, based loosely around the mechanics and tactics present in 2D fighting games. In BattleCON, players choose characters with unique abilities and powers to test against one another in a battle of tactics, strategy, and intuition.&#10;&#10;BattleCON: War of Indines is a standalone dueling card game designed for head-to-head play. Each player selects a character who uses a unique gameplay mechanism to give them an edge in combat. Take control of 18 different characters, from a fire elemental, an ocean guardian and her panda familiar, a space-bending trapper, a shadowy assassin, and more! Each character's play style requires new strategies, but uses the same foundational tactics, making a new character easy to learn, but challenging to master.&#10;&#10;Players move along a seven-space-long board, trading blows and attempting to strike the opponent, using attacks formed by combining a character's unique styles and abilities with a set of basic cards that all characters share. There is no hidden information: you always know exactly what cards the opponent holds, just not the ones they'll choose! The last player standing wins!&#10;&#10;BattleCON: War of Indines can be played on its own or combined with other BattleCON sets to create an even greater pool of characters and play variants.&#10;&#10;______________________________________________________________________________&#10;&#10;BattleCON: War of Indines has two versions, now dubbed &quot;Classic&quot; and &quot;Remastered.&quot;  The &quot;Classic&quot; version contained multiple art styles, as different fighters were drawn by different artists.

Moon and publisher ABACUSSPIELE.&#10;&#10;More than two decades after the publication of that game, Moon and ABACUSSPIELE present Airlines Europe, the design of which Moon began in 2007. According to the publisher, &quot;He wanted to preserve the feel of the original game and its successor, Union Pacific, while confronting the player with even more exciting choices.&quot; The result of that redesign process is Airlines Europe, featuring a reduced playing time, a new point structure, a European setting, and 112 tiny detailed airplanes.&#10;&#10;At its heart, Airlines Europe is a stock game, with players earning points for the stock they hold in particular airline companies when one of the randomly determined scorings takes place. On a player's turn, that player either expands an airline and claims a stock, plays stock onto the board and receives dividend, invests in a special airline called Air ABACUS or gets a certain amount of money from the bank. A player scores only for stock in play, but the value of an airline is determined by the value of the route licenses that airline owns  &ndash; thus, you're torn in terms of what to play when.&#10;&#10;Some changes compared to Airlines:&#10;&#10;&#10;     map of Europe&#10;     no flight cards &#10;     special Air ABACUS airline similar to the Union Pacific &#10;     share track system&#10;     separate victory point and money systems&#10;     airplane miniatures&#10;     no sabotage &#10;     up to 5 players&#10;     reduced playtime&#10;&#10;&#10;Some changes compared to Union Pacific:&#10;&#10;&#10;     airplane theme&#10;     map of Europe&#10;     no track cards&#10;     Air ABACUS is acquired by trading in other shares&#10;     share track system &#10;     separate victory point and money systems&#10;     up to 5 players&#10;     reduced playtime &#10;&#10;&#10;Re-implements:&#10;&#10;    Airlines&#10;    Union Pacific&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Promo Expansions:&#10;&#10;    Airlines Europe: Flight Ban (adding the option to block routes)&#10;    Airlines Europe: New Bonus Connections (adding bonus connections for the black and the brown airline)&#10;    Airlines Europe: The Presidents (adds tie breaker for stock payouts)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";5;75;10;2;75;Airlines Europe;75;2011;Christian Fiore;Aviation / Flight,Economic;Alan R.

619;7113;90730;"Dungeon in a Tin is a solo or cooperative dungeon-hack. Players descend into a dungeon randomly laid-out from a stack of tiles, fighting through the orc and goblin hordes to rescue the kidnapped maiden and collect treasure and glory.&#10;&#10;Each player takes turns to move through the dungeon one tile at a time, laying new tiles as unexplored areas are entered; every time a player enters a room, special monster dice are rolled to determine the enemies faced and the potential loot to be found. When a monster attacks, a die is rolled to determine the style of their attack; the player then chooses a card from his hand to counter with, each card being strong against some kinds of attack and weak against others.&#10;&#10;The ultimate goal of the game is for the players to fight their way to the bottom of the dungeon to rescue the captured maiden - and then fight their way out with her. The dungeon will become harder to fight through as the player delves deeper, and then harder still on the way out with a helpless rescuee in tow.&#10;&#10;This Print-and-Play game was an entry in the 'One Full-sheet Label' design contest here on BGG, and as such the printed components fit entirely on a single label sheet.

620;7121;91080;"(from GMT website:)&#10;&#10;Colombia: Nation at the Edge of Abyss&#10;&#10;Colombia in the 1990s hosted one of the world&rsquo;s last Marxist guerrilla armies, brutal drug lords, and right-wing death squads and appeared close to failing as a state.  A decade later, its Marxists had lost their top leaders and rural sanctuary, its big drug bosses were dead or in prison, and its paramilitaries were negotiating demobilization.  The Government had extended its writ to most of the countryside, restored its popularity, and improved the economy and respect for human rights.&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss takes 1 to 4 players into this multifaceted campaign for control of Colombia:  guerrillas and police, kidnapping and drug war, military sweeps and terror.  Each of four factions deploys distinct capabilities and tactics to influence Colombian affairs and achieve differing goals.  Players place and maneuver 160 wooden pieces across a colorful map and exploit event cards that cannot be fully predicted.  Accessible mechanics and components put the emphasis on game play, but Andean Abyss also provides an engrossing model of insurgency and counterinsurgency in Colombia&mdash;smoothly accounting for population control, lines of communication, terrain, intelligence, foreign aid, sanctuaries, and a host of other political, military, and economic factors.&#10;&#10;A New Kind of Card-Assisted Wargame&#10; From the award-winning designer of Wilderness War and Labyrinth, Andean Abyss features unique mechanics relating events and operations that guarantee difficult player decisions with each card flip.  Most of the game&rsquo;s 72 events are dual-use, representing alternative historical paths:  players can choose either version of the event or from an array of operations and special faction activities.  Every choice has implications for how the next card will be played.  There is no hand management:  the focus is on the map and on planning for the foreseeable&mdash;and the unforeseeable.  Die rolls are only a small part of game:  the key to victory is not luck but the ability to organize the most effective campaign.&#10;&#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction.  For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions .  Or a single player as the Colombian Government can take on the leftist FARC, the right-wing AUC, and the narco-trafficking cartels.  The non-player insurgents will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.&#10;&#10;GMT COIN Series, Volume I&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss presents a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus our new COunterINsurgency series).  A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons.

Each of the 132 cards is unique, and &quot;the cards bring the game to life as they include most of the famous characters that have appeared in the various books. The rules are relatively simple: Play a card and do what it says. Most cards have more than one action on them, and you can choose to do some or all of these actions. Some cards also allow you to play a second card, so you can chain actions&quot; (Wallace).&#10;&#10;A team of artists have recreated the city and its residents for the cards, game board and box, with Bernard Pearson coordinating that team.

Control of roads and knights can change hands during the game, so don't assume that what's yours will stay yours. City improvements are expensive, but they bring you additional VPs and other bonuses, so strive to spiff up your cities! The first player to have ten VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;The game is dice-less and resource gain and exchanging is based on each player's developments making this version less luck dependent than the original.

Explore the paintings, palettes, and pasts of the artists in this unique and challenging game for the whole family.&#10;&#10;While placing hexagonal pieces to gain palette (color) cards, players become familiar with the different color combinations that produce the many hues of an artist&rsquo;s palette, all listed on the Player Reference Card.

624;7151;92319;"Philippe Keyaerts scored gold with Small World, a new version of his Vinci that was released by Days of Wonder in 2009 to great acclaim and numerous awards. With Olympos, coming from French publisher Ystari Games, Keyaerts has another go at the simplified civilization game. The playing time for Olympos is only 60-90 minutes for 3-5 players, but says Ystari's Cyril Demaegd, &quot;Even if it's a short game, it's a gamer's game.&quot;&#10;&#10;Players take actions based on their position on a time track, along the lines of Peter Prinz' Thebes. (Says Demaegd, &quot;This is mainly a coincidence because Philippe designed this game years ago.&quot;) By spending time, players take actions, with the choices being expansion or development.

625;7153;92415;"Edited description from Bruno Faidutti's write-up of the game in his Ideal Game Library:&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses is the quintessence of bluffing, a game in which everything is played in the players' heads. Each player plays a face-down card, then each player in turn adds one more card &ndash; until someone feels safe enough to state that he can turn a number of cards face up and get only roses. Other players can then overbid him, saying they can turn even more cards face up. The highest bidder must then turn that number of cards face up, starting with his own. If he shows only roses, he wins; if he reveals a skull, he loses, placing one of his cards out of play. Two successful challenges wins the game. Skull &amp; Roses is not a game of luck; it's a game of poker face and meeting eyes.&#10;&#10;Skull &amp; Roses Red features the same gameplay as Skull &amp; Roses, with the only change being alternate rules that allow each player to control two biker gangs. Both Skull &amp; Roses Red and Skull are playable on their own, with each game containing six different biker gangs. Each Skull or Skull &amp; Roses set can be combined with another to allow for games with more than six players.&#10;&#10;";6;45;14;3;45;Skull;45;2011;Rose Kipik,Thomas Vuarchex;Bluffing,Card Game;Hervé Marly;;Auction/Bidding,Hand Management,Player Elimination;Asmodee,Granna,Lui-même;7.06547;5492;skull;8;2.0;2.5;3.535225563909773;1;0.2;K92cryrFW5;False;8;6.0;45.0;8.0;3.0;15.0;Skull;266;3-6;2381;15-45;15.99;29.95;17.99;13.51;3956;2011.0;skull
626;7169;93260;"Summoner Wars is a fast-playing, action-packed card game for 2-4 players in which they take on the role of Summoners: powerful beings who harness the power of mysterious Summoning Stones to lead their race to conquest on the war-torn planet of Itharia. These Summoners wield terrible magic on the battlefield, freezing their foes in place, draining their enemies of power, and even bringing rains of fire down from the heavens. But most notoriously, they summon their great race's hordes of warriors to the battlefield, to clash in the never-ending struggle for supremacy. A Summoner is both mage and general, and must combine their wizardly might with clever tactics to defeat the enemy Summoner on the opposite side of the battle.&#10;&#10;The Summoner Wars Master Set contains six new and different complete factions from which to choose:&#10;&#10;&bull; Play as the Shadow Elves and conceal your plans in swirling darkness!&#10;&bull; Choose the Benders and confound your foe, turning his own troops against him!&#10;&bull; Command the Vargath, mountainous goatfolk who call lightning from the heavens!&#10;&bull; Select the nefarious Sand Goblins and delight in malicious trickery!&#10;&bull; Muster the Deep Dwarves and control the forces of Geomancy!&#10;&bull; Lead the ferocious Swamp Orcs to war and hack upon your foes as they are snared in your vines!&#10;&#10;Strategy shapes the composition of each deck of cards and how they are used.

628;7173;93522;"Tetris the Card Game is based on the popular video game Tetris.&#10;&#10;In this game, the players' goal is to clear 10 lines to win the game.  Players keep a grid of 10 cards face up in front of them, flipping them as lines are cleared to keep track of their score.  Each player may hold two cards at a time in their hand.  Cards may feature blocks known as Tetriminos which can be used to clear lines or special action cards that can hinder other players.&#10;&#10;A puzzle will be displayed on the top of the draw pile.  To clear a line, players must use the Tetrimino cards in their hands.  If the Tetrimino on a card fits in this puzzle so that it completes a line (or lines) five squares across without any gaps, it can be played to clear a line (or lines).  In order to fulfill this goal, Tetriminos may be rotated.  For each line cleared, a card is flipped in that player's matrix.  If clearing a line is impossible with the player's hand or if no action cards may be played, then the player must discard a card of their choice and draw the top card of the draw pile.  The next player takes their turn and play proceeds until one player has flipped all ten cards in their matrix.&#10;&#10;";4;0;8;1;0;Tetris: The Card Game;0;2011;;Abstract Strategy,Card Game,Video Game Theme;;Tetris;Hand Management,Pattern Recognition;Fundex;4.38705;95;tetris: the card game;55;0.0;0.0;3.214285714285714;0;0.0;OaJQknDP4l;False;0;4.0;10.0;8.0;1.0;5.0;Tetris: The Card Game;7;1-4;5;5-10;0.0;0.0;19.7;0.0;75;2011.0;tetris: the card game

With war on the horizon and whisperings of a prophetic storm approaching, now is the time to gather all your strength and set out to forge your place in Terrinoth's book of legends!&#10;&#10;Rune Age is a deck-building game of adventure and conquest for 1-4 players. Set in the fantasy realm of Terrinoth (Runebound, Descent: Journeys in the Dark, Runewars, and DungeonQuest), Rune Age puts players in control of one of four races, vying for dominance in a world embroiled in conflict.&#10;&#10;Designed by Corey Konieczka, Rune Age is a unique deck-building game that centers around scenarios. The four different scenarios included in Rune Age present alternate win conditions for players, from an all-out war to determine the victor to a cooperative game experience where players all win or lose together. Scenarios not only dictate the win conditions, they also determine which card types will populate Terrinoth (forming the central card pools) and which Event cards will form the Event deck. The Event deck contains thematic challenges, enemies, and happenings that are tied to the chosen scenario, creating a new play environment each turn.&#10;&#10;Gameplay in Rune Age centers around players working to develop their individual deck of cards. At the beginning of the game, each player begins with a small assortment of cards in their deck, drawing five cards each turn to carry out their actions. Each player's deck represents their faction's military strength and capabilities. These decks will be formed with their faction-specific Unit cards and a central collection of Neutral Unit cards, Tactics cards, and Gold cards.&#10;&#10;While players begin with limited cards in their deck, through cunning and strategic use of their available cards, players can expand their deck to create a destructive force of their own clever design.

633;7229;95527;"Madeira is an island officially discovered early in the 15th century by Portuguese seafarers. Madeira, the Portuguese word for wood, refers to the dense forest that covered its wild, fertile landscape. This, and its strategic position far into the Atlantic Ocean made the island one of the most significant Portuguese discoveries. Madeira served as a &ldquo;laboratory&rdquo; for what would become the Portuguese Empire.&#10;&#10;Wheat plantations were the first means for survival on the island. After that, when D. Henrique decided to increase the economy of the Empire, sugar became the core business of Madeira. Once sugar started coming from other places in the world, such as Africa and Brazil, profits from sugar were no longer enough, and production of the very famous Madeira wine became the most important economic product of the island.&#10;&#10;Players try to adapt themselves to these constraints, working to find better fields for farming the right goods and for obtaining precious wood, essential for erecting new structures in the cities and for building ships. In turn, the ships are crucial for trading in foreign markets, as well as for taking part in new expeditions to discover other countries.&#10;Madeira has been established just as it was in the original administrative division of the island under 3 captaincies (Funchal, Machico, and Porto Santo), where the ultimate goal is to develop the Island, gaining the most prestige under and for the Portuguese Crown.&#10;&#10;The Crown of Portugal has a series of requests regarding expeditions, urbanization, opening trade routes, increasing wealth, and controlling the guilds on the islands. Three times during the game, the players gain prestige for fulfilling certain requests by the Crown. At two other times, the Crown requests that the islands change the focus of their agriculture due to the changes in the world.&#10;&#10;Players must carefully choose the correct timing to show their achievements. Too early and you don&rsquo;t gain as much prestige, too late and you risk someone else stealing the best opportunities.

Then you play one Grab, Mayhem or Antics card on another player; that player may play a Defend card to possibly prevent your action.

Another titanic struggle for global supremacy has unwittingly commenced between the animal species.&#10;&#10;Dominant Species: The Card Game is a fast-playing game that abstractly recreates a tiny portion of ancient history: the ponderous rescinding of an ice age and what that entails for the living creatures trying to adapt to the slowly-changing earth.&#10;&#10;Players will use six major animal classes &ndash; mammal, reptile, bird, amphibian, arachnid or insect &ndash; to further their goals in various terrain. Through wily card play, players will strive to become dominant at as many different terrestrial and sea biomes as possible in order to claim valuable victory points: It is survival of the fittest.&#10;&#10;All of this leads to the end game &ndash; the final descent of the ice age &ndash; where the player who has accumulated the most victory points wins the game.&#10;&#10;But somebody better become dominant quickly because it's getting mighty warm...&#10;&#10;Dominant Species: The Card Game consists of ten rounds of competition, each round occurring on ten of the twelve different Biome cards. The player who starts a competition must choose to either play one Action card or pass.&#10;&#10;Action cards consist of animals played to the table as well as events. Animals contribute their Food Chain values towards gaining valuable victory points at the various Biomes, and use their element icons to fight for control of the six Element resource cards. Animals can also sometimes suppress other animals, turning them from Healthy to Endangered, or Endangered to Extinct. Event cards can be powerful one-time effects or ongoing effects that last throughout the round.&#10; Play proceeds clockwise around the table in like fashion until every player has passed consecutively or when any one player has passed with an empty hand. At that point Element cards and the current Biome card are scored, with victorious players recording their gains on the Victory Point Track. If the competition is at a Tundra, one or more dominant players will advance one space on the Survival Track.&#10;&#10;The current Biome card as well as all played Action cards are then discarded, and a new Biome card brought into play. Finally, each player draws (and perhaps discards) new Action cards based on his position on the Survival Track, and a new competition round begins.

636;7251;96713;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Scofflaws are brawling in the streets of Deadwood. The railroad is being built, and to you and the other gangs in the badlands of South Dakota, this means one thing: cold, hard cash. As a cowboy on the wrong side of the law you know just how to take control of this shanty-town: threaten, fight, and kill off your rivals.&#10;&#10;Deadwood is a wild-and-wooly board game with a quick and deadly twist on classic worker placement games. Your gang consists of three different classes of cowboys with different strengths: greenhorns, gunslingers, and trail bosses. Cowboys ride into town to gain control of (annex) buildings and fight other gangs' cowboys in shootouts.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, the town of Deadwood consists of the Town Hall, the Church, the Sheriff's Office, the Saloon, and four other randomly drawn buildings. Additional buildings are constructed whenever a cowboy annexes the Town Hall. Each building has at least one unique ability that is used immediately, with some buildings offering more long-term advantages.&#10;&#10;A cowboy accesses these advantages by controlling the building. To gain control a player simply places one of his gang on a building tile, &quot;annexing&quot; it. Other gang leaders can try to gain control of your buildings through shootouts. The player that instigates the shootout receives a Wanted Poster token; the more cowboys you try to kill off, the more Wanted Poster tokens you collect, and the higher the fine you must pay at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;Deadwood can end one of three ways: the Train Station is placed on the board once the railroad is built and completed, there are no more Wanted Poster tokens in the Crime Pool, or any player has no more cowboys alive.

For the faithful, they instill horror. For you, on the other hand, they present a wonderful business opportunity!&#10;&#10;In The Road to Canterbury, you play a medieval pardoner who sells certificates delivering sinners from the eternal penalties brought on by these Seven Deadly Sins. You make your money by peddling these counterfeit pardons to Pilgrims traveling the road to Canterbury. Perhaps you can persuade the Knight that his pride must be forgiven? Surely the Friar's greed will net you a few coins? The Miller's wrath and the Monk's gluttony are on full public display and demand pardoning! The Wife of Bath regales herself in luxury, the Man-of-Law languishes in idleness, and that Prioress has envy written all over her broad forehead. And the naughty stories these Pilgrims tell each other are so full of iniquity they would make a barkeep blush! Pardoning such wickedness should be easy money, right?&#10;&#10;Not quite. For you to succeed as a pardoner, you'll need to do more than just sell forged pardons for quick cash. To keep your services in demand, you will actually need to lead these Pilgrims into temptation yourself! Perhaps some phony relics might help? There is also one big catch. The Seven Deadly Sins live up to their name: each sin that a Pilgrim commits brings Death one step nearer, and a dead Pilgrim pays no pardoners!&#10;&#10;So much to forgive, so little time. Will you be able to outwit your opponents by pardoning more of these Pilgrims' sins before they die or finish their pilgrimage to Canterbury?&#10;&#10;";3;60;10;2;60;The Road to Canterbury;60;2011;Hieronymus Bosch,Pixel Productions Inc.;Humor,Medieval,Religious;Alf Seegert;Cities: Canterbury,Country: England,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter;Area Control / Area Influence,Card Drafting,Hand Management,Set Collection;Eagle-Gryphon Games;6.8999;801;the road to canterbury;69;0.0;0.0;3.277777777777777;0;0.0;CEzFMe8H2w;True;0;3.0;60.0;10.0;2.0;60.0;The Road to Canterbury;18;2-3;34;60;0.0;59.16;51.95;0.0;169;2011.0;the road to canterbury

Each player takes the role of an ambitious aristocratic family. Who will be the best supporter of this young king, and the most powerful Lord of his time?&#10;&#10;In Lancaster the players want to proceed from simply being a Lord to the most powerful ally of the king. They may achieve this by developing their own knighthood as well as by clever deployment of individual knights in the counties of England, at their own castle, and to conflicts with France. In parliament, they try to push laws from which they will benefit themselves most. The player with the most power points at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;Every turn, players send their knights to the different locations:&#10;&bull; Counties, where they compete with knights from other players for rewards and the favor of the nobles.&#10;&bull; The castle, to receive income or new knights.&#10;&bull; Into conflict with France, where all players combine their power and try to gain power points.&#10;&#10;In the counties the strength of the knights is important as you can remove the knight of another player by placing a knight of your own with higher strength in the same location.&#10;&#10;";5;60;10;2;60;Lancaster;60;2011;Martin Hoffmann,Claus Stephan;Medieval;Matthias Cramer;Country: England,Queen Yellow Wave Box Series;Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Voting,Worker Placement;Queen Games;7.48258;4803;lancaster;55;0.0;0.0;3.7122839506172847;0;-2.12;2FfPhO1l1B;False;0;5.0;60.0;10.0;2.0;60.0;Lancaster;81;2-5;183;60;186.99;0.0;55.95;0.0;867;2011.0;lancaster

Well, we forgot to mention that those petz are for Dungeon Lords. This means magical, playful, sometimes angry monsters that constantly desire attention and at the very moment you want them to demonstrate their qualities to buyers they are sick or they poop. Sometimes you are even glad that you got rid of them &ndash; but the profit is unbelievable.&#10;&#10;Dungeon Petz is a standalone game set in the Dungeon Lords universe. The game consists of several rounds in which players use unusual worker placement mechanisms (players simultaneously prepare different sized groups of imps in order to play sooner than others) to prepare themselves for the uneasy task of raising creature cubs and pleasing their different needs (represented by cards) in order to sell them as grown and scary creatures to Dungeon Lords.

640;7260;97273;"At the beginning of the 16th century, the city of Rouen is the main French port. The city's wealth depends on fishing and the trading of salted fish. Salt produced in the mines has to be loaded onto ships and used to preserve herring and cod fished in the Atlantic Ocean. Every week ships full of salt barrels leave Rouen for the fishing grounds of the Atlantic Ocean, and once back, the goods are sold in the city markets. The players represent city merchants, and they invest in ships and city buildings to try to get rich. Who will be the richest merchant of Rouen, when Francis I, King of France, comes to visit the City?&#10;&#10;In Upon a Salty Ocean, players start the game with one caravel loaded with three salt barrels, a salt mine and 10-16 money. From this, they must build a shipping empire! The game lasts five turns, with each turn being divided into three phases.&#10;&#10;In the event phase, players adjust prices on the market based on the current event tile, take into the account the weather and environmental conditions that will affect them the remainder of the round, and reveal the event tile for the subsequent round.&#10;&#10;The action phase lasts a variable number of rounds depending on how many actions players want to take and can afford. Eight actions are available and they're divided into four types:&#10;&#10;&#10;    City: (1) buy a saline and (2) buy a building&#10;    Navigation: (1) travel to the ocean and fish and (2) travel to Rouen&#10;    Harbor: (1) build a ship and (2) move goods&#10;    Market: (1) sell to the market and (2) buy from the market&#10;&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, he can take any one of the either actions or pass; the cost of an action is the number of times this type of action has been performed previously during this round. For example, the first use of a City action costs 0, while the next use (whether to buy a saline or a building) costs 1. A player who passes can take an action later in the same phase. The action phase ends once all players pass. A player can go into debt during a turn, paying one coin in interest when doing so; as long as the player is in the black once the action round ends (by selling to the market), no further payment is due.&#10;&#10;In the turn end phase, players produce salt, may use special buildings, pay interest (if needed), reset the cost of the actions to zero, and so on. A player can have no more than 40 coins at the end of a turn unless he owns a banque, and the limit is 80 coins without owning Salle des Coffres. This limit is important as the player with the most coins after five rounds wins. Some buildings provide endgame bonuses to which the coin limit doesn't apply.&#10;&#10;";4;120;13;2;120;Upon a Salty Ocean;120;2011;Lamberto Azzariti;Economic,Nautical,Renaissance;Marco Pranzo;Country: France;Action Point Allowance System,Variable Phase Order;Giochix.it,Rio Grande Games,Rocks Games;6.5534;606;upon a salty ocean;54;0.0;0.0;3.2;0;0.3;1uoFMy1ZXG;False;0;4.0;120.0;13.0;2.0;120.0;Upon a Salty Ocean;15;2-4;22;120;34.95;24.99;0.0;37.37;371;2011.0;upon a salty ocean

You will each be given a large amount of money and whoever can spend it first will be the rightful heir. Visit the most exclusive theatres or eat in the most expensive restaurants. Buy old properties for the price of new ones and sell them as ruins. Host a huge party in your mansion or on your private boat. Spend like your life would depend on it. Spend to become rich! If you're the first to run through the money on hand, you'll receive the rest of his inheritance &ndash; oh, and win the game.&#10;&#10;In Last Will, each player starts with a certain amount of money, an individual player board, two errand boys and two cards in some combination of properties and helpers. At the start of each round, lay out cards from the appropriate decks on the offering boards; the four regular decks are properties, companions, events, helpers and expenses, with special cards forming a deck of their own. The particular mix of cards varies by round and by the number of players.&#10;&#10;Each player then chooses a plan for the round, with each plan indicating the number of cards the player draws (drawn immediately from the four regular decks in any combination), how many errand boys he can use later (one or two), the number of actions available to him that round, and his spot in the playing order that round. In the playing order for that round, players then take turns choosing an action with their errand boy(s), with those actions being:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take a card on display and add it to your hand.&#10;    Draw a card from any regular deck &ndash; This can be chosen only once by each player.&#10;    Visit the opera and spend $2.&#10;    Adjust the value modifiers in the property market.&#10;    Take a player board extension, thereby giving you room to play more cards.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players then take actions in the playing order for that round, with each player having as many actions as indicated on his plan. Actions let you play one-time events (which have a cost, possibly variable); helpers and recurring expenses (which are placed on your individual player board); and properties (which cost money and may depreciate over time). You can often play companions with events or recurring expenses &ndash; of course you should bring a date to the opera or a horse on your yacht! &ndash; to increase their cost. You can also use actions to activate cards on your player board, possibly with one or more companions and always with the goal of spending money. Helpers and special cards can provide you with unique powers to further boost your profligacy.&#10;&#10;At the end of each round, you must discard down to two cards in hand, and properties that can depreciate do so; this is good as a player cannot go bankrupt if he owns properties, and the only way to get rid of properties is to sell them, which regretably puts money back in your hands unless the depreciation was intense or you manipulate the market.&#10;&#10;If a player has no money and no properties, he declares bankruptcy and the game ends at the conclusion of that round; otherwise the game ends after seven rounds. The player who has the least money (or even who is most in debt) wins.&#10;&#10;";5;75;13;2;45;Last Will;75;2011;Tomáš Kučerovský;Card Game,Economic,Humor;Vladimír Suchý;Country: England,Tableau Building;Action Point Allowance System,Hand Management,Worker Placement;Czech Games Edition,Arclight,GaGa Games,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,IELLO,MINDOK,One Moment Games,REBEL.pl,Rio Grande Games;7.2707;6743;last will;0;0.0;0.0;3.4591603053435103;0;0.28;gip0b8lEIl;False;0;5.0;90.0;12.0;2.0;60.0;Last Will;131;2-5;404;60-90;35.99;54.95;48.95;32.55;1260;2011.0;last will

Your goal: Dig your claws and dirty paws into the asphalt, destroy buildings, and devour innocent meeples &ndash; in short: sow terror while having fun. The monster who has caused the most damage after the carnage finally ends wins the game.&#10;&#10;The buildings in Meeple City are comprised of floor tiles and meeples, with the meeples serving as pillars that support the floors. Four wooden vehicles are on the ground in the eight neighborhoods in the city. Each monster, which consists of a wooden paws disc and a wooden body, starts in one corner of the game board. On a turn you take two actions from four possibilities, repeating an action if desired:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Move: Pick up your monster body, flick the paws disc, then place the body back on the disc.&#10;    Demolish: If your paws are on the sidewalk surrounding a building, you can pick up your monster body, drop it onto a building, then collect any floors that have no meeples on them.&#10;    Toss a vehicle: If you're in a neighborhood with a vehicle, you can pick up the vehicle, place it on your body, then flick the vehicle at a building or another monster.&#10;    Breathe: Even while away from sidewalks with no vehicles, you can cause destruction by placing your chin on your monster's body and blowing across the board.&#10;&#10;&#10;Monsters tend to be messy when obtaining meals, but if you knock meeples off the city board, you might be punished for letting food go to waste, costing you a tooth or letting other players take an additional action. After your two actions, you can eat unprotected meeples on the ground in your neighborhood, but you can eat only as many as the number of teeth you have. If you knock another monster to the ground, you break off one of its teeth, thereby keeping it from stealing your food! Meeples come in six colors, with the colors representing different types of inhabitants: blue (journalists), green (military), yellow (blondes), grey (old people), red (heroes), and black (businessmen). For each set of six you collect in your stomach, you score 10 points at game's end. You score points for collecting floors and teeth, too, and you can also score for achieving the goal on your character card.&#10;&#10;In addition to the character card, each player has a power card and a superpower card unique to his monster, with the former lasting the entire game and the latter being a one-shot effect that's revealed only upon use.&#10;&#10;Terror in Meeple City includes rules for monsters that evolve over the course of the game, that lose points for meeples not in sets, and that want to combine two game boards to allow for play with up to eight players.&#10;&#10;";4;45;8;2;45;Terror in Meeple City;45;2013;Pierô;Action / Dexterity,Horror;Antoine Bauza,Ludovic Maublanc;Finger Flicking Games,Kaiju,Monsters;Area Movement,Set Collection,Variable Player Powers;Repos Production;6.96203;5729;terror in meeple city;8;0.0;0.0;3.2208333333333345;0;0.0;qmcl21WSOV;False;0;4.0;60.0;8.0;2.0;45.0;Terror In Meeple City;96;2-4;387;45-60;219.99;0.0;0.0;0.0;512;2013.0;terror in meeple city

Plants and animals that have gone extinct are collected in an area on the map called the tarpits. These tiles are distributed among the most populous players as victory points during four scoring rounds.&#10;&#10;Players cope with intense competition and environmental changes by starting new species and mutating them.

645;7283;98229;"Pictomania is a drawing game in which everyone is both drawing and guessing at the same time, giving a chance for those who excel only at one or the other skill to crush the dreams of other players.&#10;&#10;Pictomania lasts five rounds, and at the start of each round, you set up six randomly drawn cards on card racks visible to all players. Cards are double-sided, come in four levels of difficulty, and include seven related words on a single side. In addition to a set of guessing cards, scoring tokens, marker and drawing board, each player receives one symbol card and one number card, which together indicate which word or phrase on the revealed cards that player must draw. Bonus tokens equal to one less than the number of players are placed in the center of the table.&#10;&#10;Players simultaneously look at their cards and start to draw. While drawing, they can also watch what others are doing and place a guess card on that player's stack. Only one guess per player is allowed, and once you make a guess, you can't change your mind. Other players will ideally be playing guess cards on your stack, too. Once you have finished drawing and guessing &ndash; and you're not required to do either &ndash; take the highest-valued bonus token from the center of the table and take no other actions. Once the final bonus token is claimed, the round ends.&#10;&#10;One by one, players reveal what they were drawing and the guesses that others made. Those who guess your word earn one of your scoring tokens, with early guessers earning more points, while those who guess incorrectly have their card placed in the center of the table. Once all the guesses are resolved, you determine the black sheep &ndash; the player who made the worst guesses. If a single player has more cards in the center of the table then anyone else, then his bonus token (if any) counts as negative points. What's more, if no one guessed your word, then you throw away your bonus token, scoring nothing for it. You sum positive points for the round (a bonus token scored, and scoring tokens from the words you guessed correctly), then subtract points for the black sheep &quot;bonus&quot; and all the scoring tokens you didn't give away to determine your final score for the round, which could be negative.&#10;&#10;Reset the bonus and scoring tokens, set up six new cards, hand out the symbol and number cards and start another round.

Now, the barbaric kingdoms that lie beyond the galactic frontier are amassing their strength, choosing this pivotal moment to strike at the heart of the fading republic, establishing new empires built upon the ashes of decaying civilizations. But these outer systems are not yet strong enough to engage the forces of the Core Worlds directly. The young kingdoms must first gnaw at the edges of the crumbling frontier, developing new types of units and shrewder tactics. They must build up their energy resources to launch magnificent fleets and overwhelming ground forces.

These cards include new Units and Tactics that the players can draft into their Empires, as well as Worlds that they can invade.&#10;&#10;&bull; Empire: Each player represents an Empire that begins with a Home World and a Starting Deck. A player's Empire consists of all of the cards in his hand, draw deck, discard pile, and Warzone (tableau).&#10;&#10;&bull; Fleet Strength: Each World possesses a Fleet Strength that represents the starships that defend it from attack. A World's Fleet Strength must be matched in order for that World to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Fleet Strength that a player can use to invade a World.&#10;&#10;&bull; Ground Strength: Each World possesses a Ground Strength that represents the infantry and other ground forces that defend it from surface assault. A World's Ground Strength must be matched in order for it to be successfully invaded. Many Units possess a Ground Strength that a player can use to invade a World.&#10;&#10;&bull; Invasion: In order to add new Worlds to his Empire, a player must launch Invasions. A player performs an Invasion by discarding enough cards from his Warzone to match the Fleet Strength and Ground Strength of the World he is invading.&#10;&#10;&bull; Warzone: Each player's Empire includes a Warzone, an area in front of the player where her conquered Worlds are displayed. Players also deploy Units from their hands face up into their Warzones, and later use these Units to invade new Worlds.&#10;&#10;";5;120;10;2;60;Core Worlds;120;2011;Alex Figini,Chechu Nieto,Jim Parks,Maciej Rebisz,Sergey Rumyantsev;Card Game,Civilization,Science Fiction,Space Exploration;Andrew Parks;;Card Drafting,Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management;Stronghold Games;7.25582;3287;core worlds;96;0.0;0.0;3.517401639344263;0;0.02;Uguuoe9au0;True;0;5.0;60.0;10.0;2.0;60.0;Core Worlds;61;2-5;197;60;31.99;59.99;42.89;0.0;585;2011.0;core worlds

651;7321;99791;"Road to Enlightenment gives players control of great scientists, artists, philosophers, religious leaders, politicians, and military leaders, bringing them uniquely and individually to life. You play as one of the great monarchs from 17th and early 18th century Europe representing one of the seven top powers of the era: Austria, England, France, Poland, Russia, Spain, or Sweden. Your objective is to be recognized as the most prestigious monarch by producing the most admired art and culture, lead the continent in scientific innovations, spread or resist the spread of Catholicism, and attempt military expansion beyond your historical borders. All of this is accomplished by marshaling 134 historical &quot;luminaries&quot; &ndash; important historical figures covering every relevant domain of human achievement during the period.&#10;&#10;The luminaries are rated in between one and seven different areas of endeavour: military, politics, religion, ideas, science, art, or wealth. Additionally, each luminary has a unique Action, Enhancement, or Response based on their real historical achievements to be brought to bear in service of your nation.&#10;&#10;Consider the difference between Rembrandt and Vermeer: Both are important and wonderful artists, but in the real-life Dutch Republic, Rembrandt was famous and well-patronized, composing hundreds of celebrated portraits in his career. Vermeer was obscure and produced an order of magnitude less art in his career. In Road to Enlightenment, Rembrandt has higher ratings and gives you a benefit every single time another luminary is removed from the game, reflecting the influence and nature of his portraiture. On the other hand, Vermeer provides only a modest benefit to reflect the limited impact his career had at the time.&#10;&#10;Invading other countries in the 17th century was a complex mix of cultural, religious, and logistical considerations. These have all been baked into the various territories on the map, making it quick and easy to make decisions around where to try to attack:&#10;&#10;&#10;     You can attempt to invade only those territories that have your nation's colour on the top of the circle. Those are the only nations that could have even possibly successfully invaded that territory in real-life.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The number associated with each nation's colour indicates how difficult it would be to successfully conquer. In the case of London, it is very difficult for Spain, France, or Sweden to conquer it.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The religious symbol in the lower left corner lets the player know whether the territory is primarily Catholic, primarily Anti-Catholic (Protestant, Russian Orthodox, and other Christian branches), or primarily Islamic. If it is successfully invaded by a nation with a different religious affiliation, it has an impact on the continental struggle between religions.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     The lines connecting into London, and the anchor with an &quot;A&quot; in the lower right corner, indicate which territories need to be held by a player before they have access to attack. The anchor with an &quot;A&quot; indicates that any player who already owns another Atlantic port territory is connected and could choose to attack over the water.&#10;&#10;&#10;With Road to Enlightenment, all of the intricacies related to managing military expansion have been baked into these easy-to-use board mechanisms.&#10;&#10;In order to create a game that simulates the battle between nations for prestige &ndash; covering war, politics, religion, science, and art &ndash; while focusing on many of the diverse people of history, we've mashed up aspects from wargames, Euro games, deck-building games, and statistical sports simulations. While it is an eclectic mix, this broad spectrum approach to the game's design enabled this diverse and richly detailed set of conditions to come together in a game that is epic in scale but doesn't take all day to play.&#10;&#10;The full game is for 3-7 players; the pocket version is for 2-4.&#10;&#10;";7;150;12;2;150;Road to Enlightenment;150;2012;Heiko Günther,Sigrid Knemeyer;Age of Reason,Bluffing,Card Game,Civilization,Economic,Educational,Negotiation;Dirk Knemeyer;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter;Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Hand Management;Conquistador Games, Inc.;6.03616;159;road to enlightenment;14;0.0;0.0;0.0;0;0.0;gN3pVjSrW4;True;0;7.0;0.0;12.0;2.0;150.0;Road to Enlightenment;0;2-7;0;;29.99;0.0;0.0;0.0;89;2012.0;road to enlightenment

Gates to the beyond begin to leak open, and terrifying creatures of increasing strength steal through them. Animals, the mad, and those of more susceptible minds are driven to desperation by the supernatural forces the portals unleash. Only a handful of investigators race against time to locate the eldritch symbols necessary to seal the portals forever. Only they can stop the Ancient One beyond from finding its way to Earth and reducing humanity to cinders.&#10;&#10;Elder Sign is a fast-paced, cooperative dice game of supernatural intrigue for one to eight players by Richard Launius and Kevin Wilson, the designers of Arkham Horror. Players take the roles of investigators racing against time to stave off the imminent return of the Ancient One. Armed with tools, allies, and occult knowledge, investigators must put their sanity and stamina to the test as they adventure to locate Elder Signs, the eldritch symbols used to seal away the Ancient Ones and win the game.&#10;&#10;To locate Elder Signs, investigators must successfully endure Adventures within the museum and its environs. A countdown mechanism makes an Ancient One appear if the investigators are not quick enough. The investigators must then battle the Ancient One. A clever and thematic dice mechanism pits their exploration against monsters and the sheer difficulty of staying sane and healthy, all within the standard game duration of one to two hours.&#10;&#10;";8;90;13;1;90;Elder Sign;90;2011;Dallas Mehlhoff;Adventure,Card Game,Dice,Fantasy,Fighting,Horror,Novel-based;Richard Launius,Kevin Wilson;Arkham Horror,Cthulhu Mythos,Elder Sign,Fantasy Flight Silver Line Games,Solitaire Games;Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Modular Board,Variable Player Powers;Fantasy Flight Games,ADC Blackfire Entertainment,Arclight,Edge Entertainment,Galakta,Galápagos Jogos,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Hobby World,Stratelibri,Wargames Club Publishing;7.01705;15248;elder sign;30;0.0;0.0;3.2565170940170933;0;0.21;5e5qeOvkp3;False;0;8.0;120.0;13.0;1.0;60.0;Elder Sign;234;1-8;1126;60-120;27.49;39.95;36.95;31.8;1243;2011.0;elder sign

If 4 victims perish in the blaze or the building collapses from taking too much structural damage, the players lose.  Otherwise, the players win instantly when they rescue a 7th victim.&#10;&#10;The expert variant included in the game adds thematic elements such as flash over, combustible materials, random setup, and variations on game difficulty from novice to heroic.

The first player of the round secretly looks at two of the three suspects, optionally swapping the victim for one of these suspects. He then places a colored accusation marker below one of the suspects. The next player looks at the two suspects not just marked with an accusation marker, then places a colored accusation marker of her own, covering any markers already beneath that suspect. This continues until all four players have placed an accusation marker, with each player not being allowed to look at the suspect just accused.&#10;&#10;The round ends, and players reveal the suspects.

Each player plays as one of ten heroes, against one of four villains, and the battle takes place in one of four different dynamic environments.&#10;&#10;Each player, after selecting one of the heroes, plays a deck of 40 cards against the villain and environment decks, which &quot;play themselves&quot;, requiring the players to put the top card of the appropriate deck into play on the villain and environment turns. On each player's turn, they may play a card from their hand, use a power printed on one of their cards in play, and draw a card from their deck. Each round starts with the villain turn, continues clockwise around the table, then concludes with the environment turn. Each villain has various advantages, such as starting with certain cards in play, as specified by the villain character card. Play continues until the heroes reduce the villain to 0 or fewer HP, or until the villain defeats the heroes, either via a win condition or by reducing all the heroes to 0 or fewer HP.&#10;&#10;";5;60;8;1;30;Sentinels of the Multiverse;60;2011;Adam Rebottaro;Card Game,Comic Book / Strip,Fighting;Christopher Badell,Paul Bender,Adam Rebottaro;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Sentinel Comics,Solitaire Games,Superheroes;Co-operative Play,Hand Management,Variable Player Powers;Greater Than Games (Sentinel Comics),Gigante Jogos;7.35481;11002;sentinels of the multiverse;65;0.0;0.0;3.3247549019607856;0;0.0;4bnR8NO0Pr;False;0;5.0;60.0;8.0;2.0;30.0;Sentinels of the Multiverse;204;2-5;1489;30-60;99.99;56.99;55.95;0.0;1207;2011.0;sentinels of the multiverse
662;7371;102680;"Set in ancient Rome, Trajan is a development game in which players try to increase their influence and power in various areas of Roman life such as political influence, trading, military dominion and other important parts of Roman culture.&#10;&#10;The central mechanism of the game uses a system similar to that in Mancala or pit-and-pebbles games. In Trajan, a player has six possible actions: building, trading, taking tiles from the forum, using the military, influencing the Senate, and placing Trajan tiles on his tableau.&#10;&#10;At the start of the game, each player has two differently colored pieces in each of the six sections (bowls) of his tableau. On a turn, the player picks up all the pieces in one bowl and distributes them one-by-one in bowls in a clockwise order. Wherever the final piece is placed, the player takes the action associated with that bowl; in addition, if the colored pieces in that bowl match the colors shown on a Trajan tile next to the bowl (with tiles being placed at the start of the game and through later actions), then the player takes the additional action shown on that tile.&#10;&#10;What are you trying to do with these actions? Acquire victory points (VPs) in whatever ways are available to you &ndash; and since this is a Feld design, you try to avoid being punished, too. At the Forum you try to anticipate the demands of the public so that you can supply them what they want and not suffer a penalty. In the Senate you acquire influence which translates into votes on VP-related laws, ideally snagging a law that fits your long-term plans. With the military, you take control of regions in Europe, earning more points for those regions far from Rome.&#10;&#10;All game components are language neutral, and the playing time is 30 minutes per player.&#10;&#10;";4;120;12;2;60;Trajan;120;2011;Jo Hartwig;Ancient,Political;Stefan Feld;Ancient Rome,Quined Master Print Edition Series;Area Movement,Card Drafting,Hand Management,Set Collection;Ammonit Spiele,Asterion Press,FoxMind,Gigamic,HUCH! & friends,Hutter Trade GmbH + Co KG,Passport Game Studios,Quined Games;7.81433;9632;trajan;13;0.0;0.0;3.7987567440769396;0;0.39;z2GeV6FSRZ;False;10;4.0;96.0;12.0;2.0;84.0;Trajan;189;2-4;1620;84-96;43.0;84.99;69.99;0.0;2551;2011.0;trajan
663;7374;102794;"Following along the same lines as its predecessor (Agricola), Caverna: The Cave Farmers is a worker-placement game at heart, with a focus on farming. In the game, you are the bearded leader of a small dwarf family that lives in a little cave in the mountains. You begin the game with a farmer and his spouse, and each member of the farming family represents an action that the player can take each turn. Together, you cultivate the forest in front of your cave and dig deeper into the mountain. You furnish the caves as dwellings for your offspring as well as working spaces for small enterprises.&#10;&#10;It's up to you how much ore you want to mine. You will need it to forge weapons that allow you to go on expeditions to gain bonus items and actions. While digging through the mountain, you may come across water sources and find ore and ruby mines that help you increase your wealth. Right in front of your cave, you can increase your wealth even further with agriculture: You can cut down the forest to sow fields and fence in pastures to hold your animals. You can also expand your family while running your ever-growing farm. In the end, the player with the most efficiently developed home board wins.&#10;&#10;You can also play the solo variant of this game to familiarize yourself with the 48 different furnishing tiles for your cave.&#10;&#10;Caverna: The Cave Farmers, which has a playing time of roughly 30 minutes per player, is a complete redesign of Agricola that substitutes the card decks from the former game with a set of buildings while adding the ability to purchase weapons and send your farmers on quests to gain further resources. Designer Uwe Rosenberg says that the game includes parts of Agricola, but also has new ideas, especially the cave part of your game board, where you can build mines and search for rubies. The game also includes two new animals: dogs and donkeys.&#10;&#10;";7;210;12;1;30;Caverna: The Cave Farmers;210;2013;Klemens Franz;Animals,Economic,Fantasy,Farming;Uwe Rosenberg;Animals: Sheep,Harvest Series,Mining,Solitaire Games;Tile Placement,Worker Placement;Lookout Games,999 Games,Crowd Games,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Gemenot,Hobby Japan,HomoLudicus,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,Lacerta,Ludofy Creative,Mayfair Games,MINDOK,Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.,uplay.it edizioni;8.18155;16798;caverna: the cave farmers;5;2.0;3.0;3.841553387154806;0;0.29;0DAMHQym7H;False;8;7.0;180.0;12.0;1.0;120.0;Caverna: The Cave Farmers;292;1-7;1200;120-180;64.24;123.95;89.27;57.25;3915;2013.0;caverna: the cave farmers

The cards are both buildings and currency, and the first player to collect 50 victory points wins the game. Victory points are cumulative from round to round, so a fast start yields a big advantage.&#10;&#10;Each turn, each player places a card from his hand face down, then all cards are simultaneously revealed. The cards show the buildings that the players want to build that round; building costs are paid for by discarding other cards. Some buildings provide income at the end of the round in the form of new cards, with certain buildings increasing the income provided by others; similarly, some buildings boost the VPs provided by others, with a University, for example, being worth one more VP for each School you have in play.&#10;&#10;Certain buildings have symbols on them &ndash; car, fountain, shopping cart - and the income and VPs provided by some buildings depends on how many symbols you have in play; the Autobahn, for example, is worth one dollar (i.e., card) and one VP for each car symbol you control.&#10;&#10;";5;20;10;2;20;The City;20;2011;Klemens Franz;Card Game,City Building;Thomas Lehmann;;Hand Management,Simultaneous Action Selection;999 Games,AMIGO Spiel + Freizeit GmbH,G3,Gigamic;6.563389999999999;1467;the city;77;2.0;2.0;3.428571428571428;0;0.0;VTEhqwFAfn;True;0;5.0;30.0;10.0;2.0;20.0;The City;21;2-5;286;20-30;0.0;54.99;35.06;0.0;339;2011.0;the city

666;7402;103670;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The year is 1947, and World War II still rages, fueled by the discovery of alien technology. The world's superpowers have developed unprecedented weaponry, including lasers, phaser cannons, and massive combat walkers. These war machines stride across the battlefield, protected by their heavy armor, and devastate enemy troops with their fearsome cannons.&#10;&#10;In Dust Warfare, players assume the roles of generals, each commanding a custom-built army of squads, walkers, and heroes. Draw upon Axis might or Allied versatility as you wage ferocious battles for control of the rare ore, VK, needed to fuel the most powerful of the superpowers' weapons.&#10;&#10;The Dust Warfare rulebook introduces unprecedented player engagement. Players first get drawn into the action during the Command Phase, where you have to choose how to spend command points during an escalating battle. You might spend command points early and often to advance and sustain an early lead, or you might save them up for dramatic late-game effects that may decisively turn the tide of battle. The Command Phase presents players with the chance to exert their influence and command style upon the field of battle in an engaging new way.&#10;&#10;Players have the chance to activate all their forces during the Unit Phase, and reaction mechanisms keep you fully engaged throughout your opponent's turns. As enemy units close in on yours or begin to open fire, you can choose to spend actions from your next turn to react. Keen commanders will make good use of their reaction options. They will also learn how best to feint and bait their opponents to react, draining them of available actions.&#10;&#10;Designed by renowned miniatures guru Andy Chambers, the Dust Warfare: Core Rulebook integrates dynamic and engaging new game design with the stunning models from Dust Tactics. Dust Warfare players build armies from the exact same set of miniatures as Dust Tactics. As both games go forward, they will continue to draw from the same wealth of fantastically detailed miniatures.&#10;&#10;Integrates with:&#10;&#10;    Dust Tactics&#10;    Dust Tactics: Revised Core Set&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";4;120;14;2;120;Dust Warfare: Core Rulebook;120;2012;Davide Fabbri,Matthias Haddad,Mathieu Harlaut,Karl Kopinski,Mike Nash,Paolo Parente,Alessia Zambonin;Miniatures,Science Fiction,World War II;Andy Chambers,Mack Martin;CMGs (Collectible Miniatures Games),Dust;Action Point Allowance System,Dice Rolling,Variable Player Powers;Fantasy Flight Games;7.70858;134;dust warfare: core rulebook;93;0.0;0.0;2.0;0;0.37;obf84JajRM;False;0;4.0;120.0;14.0;2.0;120.0;Dust Warfare: Core Rulebook;1;2-4;0;120;25.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;41;2012.0;dust warfare: core rulebook

As you are brave adventurers, you venture into the magic labyrinth to free the wizard &ndash; but you cannot do this without the help of its inhabitants. Visit the inhabitants and bring them certain items. You will receive coveted magic stones as a reward! The first player to fill his magic key with the magic stones and return to his starting field wins. But beware! Danger lurks everywhere...&#10;&#10;In Das Elektronik Labyrinth, designer Reiner Knizia marries his facility for electronics in board games (e.g., Wer war's? and Die Insel) with Max J. Kobbert's long-running Labyrinth series of games from Ravensburger.&#10;&#10;The basic game play is the same as in Labyrinth. The board has a set of tiles fixed solidly onto it; the remaining tiles slide in and out of the rows created by the fixed tiles to make up the labyrinth. One tile stands outside the labyrinth, and on a player's turn, he takes this tile and slides it into a row, moving all the tiles and pushing one out the other side of the board, which becomes the piece for the next player to add to the maze.&#10;&#10;After inserting the tile, the player may move his pawn. Each player starts on a corner of the game board and must reach the starting location diagonally opposite. If he manages to do so, he gains a number of magic stones. A player can also acquire magic stones from the inhabitants of the labyrinth. If a player lands on an inhabitant, it tells the players what item it desires. A player who finds the item, with items being scattered throughout the labyrinth, can deliver it to the inhabitant for a reward. What's more, an inhabitant may give a visiting player a treasure chest to be delivered to another inhabitant, also for a reward.&#10;&#10;In order to complete his magic key and free the wizard, a player needs fifteen magic stones. The first player that returns to his starting location with a complete key wins.&#10;&#10;The game comes with a &quot;book&quot; containing electronics. This book takes care of all the interactions with the inhabitants of the labyrinth. Whenever a player interacts with an inhabitant, he pushes the corresponding buttons from the book, and the book will respond by telling the player his assignment, reward, etc.&#10;&#10;";4;60;8;2;45;Electronic Labyrinth;60;2011;Joachim Krause;Electronic,Fantasy,Maze;Reiner Knizia,Max J.

668;7414;103886;"It is a dark time for the galaxy. The Galactic Empire has consolidated its dominion through the might of the Imperial Navy. In the underworld of the Empire's most populated planets, and in strongholds throughout the Outer Rim, powerful gangsters rule vast criminal organizations. From the shadows, those lost to the grip of the dark side of the Force scheme to bring their evil designs to bear on an already oppressed galaxy.&#10;&#10;Yet not all hope is lost. The Rebel Alliance resists the iron grip of the Empire. Smugglers and other fringe elements lend their aid to the Rebellion. And unknown to the Emperor and his dark minions of the Sith, the last remnants of the noble Jedi Order work tirelessly to restore peace and order to the galaxy.&#10;&#10;Star Wars: The Card Game is a two-player card game that puts one player in command of the Rebels (light side, with the factions Jedi, Rebel Alliance, and Smugglers And Spies), and one player in command of the Empire (dark side, with the factions Sith, Imperial Navy, and Scum And Villainy). The Balance of the Force expansion allows multi-player games. The game is set within the time-frame of the original Star Wars trilogy.&#10;&#10;Each player has a deck of objective cards representing various missions plus a deck of player cards of units (characters, vehicles, droids and creatures), events, enhancements and fates. Each objective is linked to a set of five player cards. Deck construction consists of choosing which objectives are to go into your objective deck, then adding each of those objective's set of five player cards to your player deck. Game play consists of deploying cards to your tableau, attacking your opponent's objectives, defending your own objectives, and committing cards to the Force Struggle.&#10;&#10;The Empire wins if the Death Star dial reaches 12, with this dial increasing by one on each dark side turn, effectively putting a timer on the game. It may also be increased by winning the Force struggle, destroying light side objectives, and via card effects.

669;7417;104006;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Life in the village is hard &ndash; but life here also allows the inhabitants to grow and prosper as they please. One villager might want to become a friar. Another might feel ambitious and strive for a career in public office. A third one might want to seek his luck in distant lands.&#10;&#10;Each player will take the reins of a family and have them find fame and glory in many different ways. There is one thing you must not forget, however: Time will not stop for anyone and with time people will vanish. Those who will find themselves immortalized in the village chronicles will bring honor to their family and be one step closer to victory.&#10;&#10;Village is a game full of tactical challenges. A smart and unique new action mechanism is responsible for keeping turns short and yet still tactically rich and full of difficult decisions. Also unique is the way this game deals with the delicate subject of death; as a natural and perpetual part of life in the village, thoughts of death will keep you focused on smart time-management.&#10;&#10;Paraphrased from Opinionated Gamer's review:&#10;&#10;Each player&rsquo;s turn consists of taking a cube and then taking the action of the area they just took the cube from.  The board has multiple different zones with specific attributes, a market, a travel zone, a crafting zone, a church, and a council house.  Many of these offer multiple options, so even if you take a cube from the crafting area, you can get an ox, a horse, a cart, a plow, a scroll, or convert wheat to gold.  Each zone is seeded with cubes of four colors plus black cubes which serve as curses, there are lots of turns per round. Some areas offer short-term scoring, others offer long-term scoring, and still others offer only end-game scoring. The round ends when there are no cubes at any location.  The game ends when either the village chronicle or the anonymous graveyard is full.&#10;&#10;";4;90;12;2;60;Village;90;2011;Dennis Lohausen;Farming,Medieval;Inka Brand,Markus Brand;Village;Set Collection,Worker Placement;999 Games,Albi,Delta Vision Publishing,eggertspiele,Fantasmagoria,Fire on Board Jogos,Gigamic,hobbity.eu,Hobby Japan,KADABRA,Kaissa Chess & Games,Lautapelit.fi,Ludicus,Ludonova,Pegasus Spiele,Stronghold Games,Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.,Tasty Minstrel Games,uplay.it edizioni,Zvezda;7.56775;13707;village;11;3.0;3.0;3.612805662805662;0;0.0;TtPHSNukZB;False;0;4.0;90.0;12.0;2.0;60.0;Village;210;2-4;648;60-90;0.0;74.99;65.95;0.0;1953;2011.0;village
670;7426;104363;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Rex: Final Days of an Empire, a reimagined version of Dune set in Fantasy Flight's Twilight Imperium universe, is a board game of negotiation, betrayal, and warfare in which 3-6 players take control of great interstellar civilizations, competing for dominance of the galaxy's crumbling imperial city. Set 3,000 years before the events of Twilight Imperium, Rex tells the story of the last days of the Lazax empire, while presenting players with compelling asymmetrical racial abilities and exciting opportunities for diplomacy, deception, and tactical mastery.&#10;&#10;In Rex: Final Days of an Empire, players vie for control of vital locations across a sprawling map of the continent-sized Mecatol City. Only by securing three key locations (or more, when allied with other factions) can a player assert dominance over the heart of a dying empire.&#10;&#10;Unfortunately, mustering troops in the face of an ongoing Sol blockade is difficult at best (unless, of course, you are the Federation of Sol or its faithless ally, the Hacan, who supply the blockading fleet). Savvy leaders must gather support from the local populace, uncover hidden weapon caches, and acquire control over key institutions. Mechanically, this means players must lay claim to areas that provide influence, which is then &quot;spent&quot; to (among other things) smuggle military forces through the orbiting Sol blockade. Those forces will be needed to seize the key areas of the city required to win the game. From the moment the first shot is fired, players must aggressively seek the means by which to turn the conflict to their own advantage.&#10;&#10;While the great races struggle for supremacy in the power vacuum of a dead emperor, massive Sol warships execute their devastating bombardments of the city below. Moving systematically, the Federation of Sol's fleet of warships wreaks havoc on the planet's surface, targeting great swaths of the game board with their destructive capabilities. Only the Sol's own ground forces have forewarning of the fleet's wrath; all others must seek shelter in the few locations with working defensive shields...or be obliterated in the resulting firestorm.&#10;&#10;Although open diplomacy and back-door dealmaking can often mitigate the need for bloodshed, direct combat may prove inevitable. When two or more opposing forces occupy the same area, a battle results. Each player's military strength is based on the sum total of troops he is willing to expend, along with the strength rating of his chosen leader. A faction's leaders can therefore be vitally important in combat...but beware! One or more of your Leaders may secretly be in the employ of an enemy, and if your forces in combat are commanded by such a traitor, defeat is all but assured. So whether on the field of battle or the floor of the Galactic Council, be careful in whom you place your trust.&#10;&#10;All this, along with a host of optional rules and additional variants, means that no two games of Rex: Final Days of an Empire will play exactly alike. Contributing further to replayability is the game's asymmetrical faction abilities, each of which offer a unique play experience.&#10;&#10;";6;120;14;3;120;Rex: Final Days of an Empire;120;2012;Dallas Mehlhoff;Fighting,Negotiation,Political,Science Fiction;Bill Eberle,John Goodenough,Jack Kittredge,Corey Konieczka,Peter Olotka,Christian T.

672;7450;105037;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Built by the Romans during the first century in Belgian Gaul, Tournay experienced most of its growth along the Scheldt river. Unfortunately, the river also contributed to its troubles, because in 881, the Normans traversed its watery path, and thereby easily captured the city. That act of aggression stunted Tournay's prosperity. This game invites you to participate in the reconstruction of the city, in order to establish a glorious era that will last for more than seven centuries. Help your district flourish by cleverly coordinating the work of the city's three domains: military, religious, and civil. Certainly the prestige of your buildings will brighten the entire city!&#10;&#10;Tournay is a card game from the same designing team as the 2010 release Troyes with artwork once again by Alexandre Roche. In this game, players manage a district of the city and its three classes of citizens. The cards are classified by level (I to III) and color to form nine distinct decks. Players initially have two citizens in each class that they will use each turn to carry out one of five available actions, such as drawing cards, or using the powers of their buildings.&#10;&#10;In each player's district, the building cards save them money, make more efficient use of the decks of cards, or recruit new citizens. The character cards optimize the use of buildings if properly positioned. It's up to you to create the most effective card combinations. Finally, constructed prestige buildings will give you valuable prestige points, depending on how your district has developed. But beware: Your opponents will also benefit from every prestige building you build!&#10;&#10;Note that an expansion is included in the base game's box, so advanced players can add still more replay value to this dynamic game!&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;There are 3 sets of cards (yellow, red, white) in 3 groups (I, II, III); also, a set of black event cards. There are always 3 face-up event cards, most of which are bad. Players start with 2 meeples in 3 colors (yellow, red, white), placed on their Plaza card.&#10;&#10;On your turn:&#10;&#10;     First, you may play a card from hand to your display (3x3 grid) by paying the appropriate cost (some combination of coins, meeples, cards, etc). You may play a card on top of another of the same color; if played on top of a different color, discard the older card. &#10;     Then take one action:&#10;         Draw a card; move 1-3 meeples off the Plaza to draw a level I-III card; you may pay others 2 coins to use their worker(s). If you draw the event card of that deck, place a coin on each event card, then trigger all event cards once per coin.&#10;         Activate a building card by moving a meeple from your Plaza to the building card (max 1 Meeple/building); cards do a variety of things like give you coins, recruit an additional meeple, use someone else's card, etc.&#10;         Combat an event by paying the cost (usually 1 Meeple, 1 coin, +1/coin on the card; or, 2 meeples) shown; take the card as a reward. Later, when events trigger, you may play this from hand to prevent an event from affecting you.&#10;         Reactivate all workers: return all meeples to your Plaza, and remove all markers from building cards.&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The game ends at the start of the Start Player's turn if 2+ players have all 9 cards in their display; OR if only 1 player has, but at least n-1 Town Crier cards have been revealed. Everyone then gets to play one final card (paying normal costs). Earn VPs for all cards in display, and for all Event cards you've combated. Most VP wins!&#10;&#10;";4;60;12;2;30;Tournay;60;2011;Alexandre Roche;Card Game,City Building,Economic,Medieval;Sébastien Dujardin,Xavier Georges,Alain Orban;Country: Belgium,Tableau Building;Card Drafting,Hand Management,Worker Placement;Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Pearl Games,uplay.it edizioni,Z-Man Games;7.084110000000001;2303;tournay;9;0.0;0.0;3.1484375;0;0.0;eQMnHWxiGL;False;0;4.0;60.0;12.0;2.0;30.0;Tournay;32;2-4;195;30-60;0.0;0.0;30.95;0.0;375;2011.0;tournay

They will explore territories, harvest resources, use those resources in markets both internal (for their use and that of the natives) and foreign (to sell it in Europe), build markets, harbors, cities and temples, and negotiate among themselves (and maybe betray each other) &ndash; all this to complete their secret objectives. They will also need to guess the secret objective of the other players to be able to benefit from them.&#10;&#10;But players also need to be careful of the natives; if they make them too unhappy or if too many of them are unoccupied, they could revolt and declare independence.

During his turn, a player plays his terrain card and builds three settlements on three hexes of this kind. If possible, a new settlement must be built next to one of that player&rsquo;s existing settlements. When building next to a location, the player may seize an extra action tile that he may use from his next turn on. These extra actions allow extraordinary actions such as moving your settlements.&#10;&#10;By building next to a castle, the player will earn gold at the end of the game, but the most gold will be earned by meeting the conditions of the three Kingdom Builder cards; these three cards (from a total of ten in the game) specify the conditions that must be met in order to earn the much-desired gold, such as earning gold for your settlements built next to water hexes or having the majority of settlements in a sector of the board.&#10;&#10;Each game, players will use a random set of Kingdom Builder cards (3 of 10), special actions (4 of 8), and terrain sectors to build the map (4 of 8), ensuring you won't play the same game twice!&#10;&#10;Kingdom Builder FAQ - please read before posting questions in the forum.&#10;&#10;";4;45;8;2;45;Kingdom Builder;45;2011;Oliver Schlemmer;Medieval,Territory Building;Donald X.

In each round the players simultaneously choose and reveal one of their actions that will allow them to allocate one of their Minions to an area on their Lair, obtain money, obtain a blueprint for an invention, or build one of their inventions if they have enough money to do so. The minions that you allocate to your Lair can earn you additional income depending on the actions that your neighbors choose.

After each raid, the Dreadfleet disappears into its lair as quickly and silently as it appeared, far from the reach of Man. And yet there remains hope. Captain Jaego Roth of the Heldenhammer has vowed to hunt down and destroy Count Noctilus and his Undead captains once and for all. With him sail the most notorious and cunning of the pirate lords of Sartosa, each borne to battle upon a giant warship bristling with cannons, organ guns and bolt throwers. At the stroke of midnight on Geheimnisnacht, most forsaken of nights, the Heldenhammer and her companions sail into the realm of undeath known as the Galleon's Graveyard. One by one, Count Noctilus and his vile allies move in to stop them.&#10;&#10;Dreadfleet is a boxed game for two (or more) players that includes everything you need to make war on the turbulent seas of the Warhammer world. At your command are two fleets of ships: the Dreadfleet led by the Vampire Count Noctilus, aboard his gargantuan sea-hulk the Bloody Reaver; and the Grand Alliance commanded by the Pirate Captain Jaego Roth, who recently stole the Heldenhammer &ndash; the pride of the Imperial Fleet, and one of the largest galleons to ever sail the high seas.&#10;&#10;As your ships engage in furious battle, it's down to you, the fleet captain, to make important split-second decisions. Do you bring all guns to bear on the closest enemy warship, or do you sail into position for a furious broadside? What happens when the warship catches fire, or worse, the powder kegs ignite? Exactly how much punishment can your warship take before it sinks without a trace? Are those Undead seagulls or flying piranha fish?

Equip your ancestral magical items, summon your most faithful familiars to your side and be ready to face the challenge!&#10;&#10;Seasons is a tactical game of cards and dice which takes place in two phases:&#10;&#10;The first phase &quot;Prelude&quot; consists of a card draft: the goal during this phase will be to establish own 9-card deck for the main part of the game and with it the strategy.&#10;&#10;Once the Prelude is complete, each player must separate his 9 cards into 3 packs of 3 cards. He will begin the second phase of the game with his first pack of three cards, then gradually as the game progresses, he will receive the other two packets of three cards.&#10;&#10;Next comes the Tournament: at the beginning of each round a player will roll the seasons dice (dice = number of players +1).&#10;&#10;These cubes offer a variety of actions to the players: &#10;- Increase your gauge (maximum number of cards you may have placed on the table and in play) &#10;- Harvesting energy (water, earth, fire, air) to pay the cost of power cards&#10;- Crystallizing the energy (during the current season) to collect crystals. Crystals serve both as a resource to pay for some cards, but also as victory points in the end. &#10;- Draw new cards&#10;&#10;Each player can choose only one die per turn. The die not chosen by anyone determines how many fields the &quot;time track&quot; would move forward.&#10;In addition, all the dice are different depending on the season. For example, there are not the same energies to a particular season. Throughout the game, players will therefore have to adapt to these changes - also the &quot;exchange rates&quot; of energy to crystals vary during seasons - the energy not present on the dice in any given season is also the best paid during the season.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, the crystals are summed with victory points granted by the cards (minus some penalties, where applicable).

678;7508;108906;"Thunder Alley is a stock car racing game for 2&ndash;7 players with the feel and flexibility of a card-driven simulation. Drafting, teamwork, accidents, yellow flags, pit strategy, working to lead laps, and sprints to the finish are all included and bring the feel of racing to the game. Players control not one car, but a team of 3&ndash;6 cars. Thus, each race is not only a run for the checkered flag but an effort to maximize the score for every car on your team. Winning is important, but if only one car crosses the finish line, your team might end up outside the winner's circle looking in.&#10;&#10;The game includes four different types of movement, often with many cars moving with the play of a single card, and each type has its place and time:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Solo movement allows you to break away from the pack.&#10;    Draft and pursuit movement are best used for keeping your team of cars together.&#10;    Lead movement can create a pack of cars that moves toward the front.&#10;&#10;&#10;Turns are fast, each play is important, and the track situation is fluid. The wrong movement in the wrong situation can be disastrous, with you possibly being left out of the draft and all alone. Experienced players will be able to identify the best type of movement for the current situation.&#10;&#10;Cars suffer wear over the course of a race and need to take pit stops. Tire wear, suspension difficulties, fuel issues, and major engine and transmission problems are all modeled in the game. If you feel lucky, you might try to hold it together just a little bit longer in hopes that a yellow flag will come out and cause a mass rush into the pits. Waiting on a yellow that never comes can be maddening as the rest of the pack moves by your worn-out car. What's more, an events deck can make your strategy pay off or punish you for your failure to take precautions. Accidents, yellow flags, worsening track situations, and deteriorating cars are all part of the game. Could all of your perfect strategy be derailed by those incoming rain clouds?&#10;&#10;Included in the game are four different race tracks: a tri-oval super speedway for wide-open free-wheeling racing and a short track for a tight wheel-to-wheel bumper car duel. Each track uses the same deck of racing cards but the cards that work best on one may be useless in the other.  The game also includes a second board with a road course and and 3 turned  (triangle) raceway.&#10;&#10;Most racing games call for a large number of players to play the game at its best.

In 1625, the Thirty Years' War is underway, and military leaders like Albrecht von Wallenstein and Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim are roaming the country, fighting for land, and trying to establish the best of everything for themselves. The game lasts two &quot;years,&quot; with players taking actions in the spring, summer, and fall, then possibly suffering from grain shortage and revolts in the winter before scoring points for the year. After two years, the player with the most points &ndash; with points being scored for land and buildings under one's control &ndash; wins.&#10;&#10;In each of the &quot;action&quot; seasons, ten action cards are shuffled, then laid out, with five face-up and the rest face-down. The five bonus tiles (which provide extra money, grain, or armies) are also laid out. Each player then secretly assigns one of his county cards (or a blank card) to each of the ten actions on his individual player board, in addition to bidding for player order and choice of bonus tile.&#10;&#10;After revealing that round's event card and determining player order, players carry out actions in the order determined earlier, revealing which county is taking the current action, then revealing the next face-down action, thus giving players some information about when actions will occur, but not all. Taxing a county or taking grain from it can increase the chance of a revolt during winter, but without money you can't deploy troops or build palaces or churches and without grain you increase the chance of revolt.&#10;&#10;Combat and revolts are handled via a dice tower in which players drop army units and peasants (colored wooden cubes) into the top of the tower and see which ones emerge in the bottom tray (representing the fighting forces for that combat) and which get stuck in the tower's baffles to possibly emerge in the future.&#10;&#10;Wallenstein includes two expansions: &quot;Emperor's Court,&quot; in which a player's army tokens that fall from the dice tower at the start of the game become courtiers who compete for favors (special actions) from the emperor; a player can convert armies to courtiers during the game, and whoever has the most courtiers in the court's entrance hall each turn gets first shot at the favors available. &quot;Landsknechte,&quot; which can be used with &quot;Emperor's Court&quot; or on its own, consists of a set of four cards for each player stacked in a particular order. If after determining turn order, a player controls counties in four different regions, he removes the top card from the stack, then takes one of the bonuses (such as money or armies in the tray) shown on the newly revealed card. This stack resets after winter ends.&#10;&#10;";5;120;12;2;90;Wallenstein (second edition);120;2012;Oliver Schlemmer;Economic,Renaissance,Territory Building;Dirk Henn;Country: Germany,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter;Action / Movement Programming,Action Point Allowance System,Area Control / Area Influence,Area Movement,Simultaneous Action Selection,Variable Phase Order;Queen Games;7.695869999999998;968;wallenstein (second edition);46;0.0;0.0;3.833333333333333;0;-0.61;MGfnrRaM9y;True;0;5.0;120.0;12.0;2.0;90.0;Wallenstein (second edition);12;2-5;15;90-120;99.95;0.0;0.0;0.0;429;2012.0;wallenstein (second edition)

The game board depicts a garden as a 6x6 grid in which seed and vegetable tiles are placed using dice rolls as coordinates. Players take turns using the dice to plant, water, and harvest five different types of vegetables with differing point values, from the lowly squash to the mighty eggplant.&#10;&#10;The game's chaining mechanism allows players to water or harvest multiple tiles using a single action, enabling players to build upon each others' chains. Players can also use bird and rabbit tiles to eat other players' seed and veggie tiles, but not without paying a small penalty. Two other special tiles &ndash; the sundial and the scarecrow &ndash; allow players to modify dice rolls or protect their own tiles.&#10;&#10;The Gnome expansion included in Garden Dice can be added to the base game to give players the ability to adjust the dice rolls for purchasing, watering, and harvesting their vegetables, leading to a more strategic experience.&#10;&#10;Bonuses increase the values of tiles as they are harvested, and additional points are awarded at the end of the game for collecting sets.

683;7543;111105;"A STORYTELLING BOARD GAME SET IN THE 1970s COLD WAR ERA.&#10;&#10;SMERSH is a portmanteau of two Russian words that translates to &quot;Death to Spies.&quot;  It operated as a counter-intelligence agency by the Red Army during the 1940s. Despite having had a large number of paid employees, little was known about the agency until recently when Russia opened their archives.&#10;&#10;Agents of SMERSH is a cooperative Storytelling game that pits players as UN Secret Service Spies set in an alternate 1970s timeline against a newly formed and independent SMERSH. Agents of SMERSH includes custom dice to determine success or failure of encounters,  and more strategic play from what is typically expected of a Storytelling board game.  There are plenty of James Bond gadgets, guns, cars, pop references and detailed artwork - not to mention a touch of humor.  The game features the artwork of George Patsouras (The Resistance &amp; Flash Point).&#10;&#10;The game is able to accommodate play with either The Encounter Book, which contains over 1500 written encounters with a similar reaction matrix to Tales of the Arabian Nights -  or played more simply with only encounter cards with shorter encounters and no matrix. The First Edition (2012) of the game came with the Encounter Cards as standard, and the Encounter Book as an optional add-on (although many copies did actually include the book). The Second Edition (2015) includes the Encounter Book as standard, with the Encounter Cards available to purchase from the publisher.&#10;&#10;";4;90;13;1;90;Agents of SMERSH;90;2012;George Patsouras,Julia Semionova;Adventure,Spies/Secret Agents;Jason Maxwell;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Solitaire Games;Area Movement,Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Point to Point Movement,Role Playing,Storytelling,Variable Player Powers;8th Summit;7.08962;1289;agents of smersh;77;0.0;0.0;3.428823529411764;0;-7.95;QriupdemvI;False;0;4.0;90.0;13.0;1.0;90.0;Agents of SMERSH;34;1-4;69;90;337.99;0.0;29.74;0.0;431;2012.0;agents of smersh

685;7551;111341;"The Great Zimbabwe is a game about building a trade based civilization in ancient Africa. It has been inspired by the old kingdoms surrounding the Great Zimbabwe, a world heritage site in southern Africa. Far into the previous century, colonial governments denied that a civilization that produced such impressive monuments and beautiful artwork could have been African in origin. But of course, this civilization was African, and the country of Zimbabwe itself was proudly named after this impressive cultural heritage. As always in our games, we have used this history for inspiration; however, first and foremost we wanted to create a highly playable and replayable Splotter game, so in many cases we took liberties with historical names, periods and artwork.&#10;&#10;In the game, players strive to build the most impressive monuments to one god of their choice. They can choose this god themselves-- each of the twelve gods offers a unique blessing, but each also requires a different amount of work to win the game. Building the monuments is done by developing a logistics network stretching across the region. Through this network, players produce and obtain ritual goods to raise their monuments and bring honour to the god of their choice.&#10;&#10;Here's the flavour text from the rules:&#10;&#10;The Mutapa king struts into the village, followed by a bunch of young warriors herding cattle. &ldquo;Oondabezitha &rdquo;, he addresses the assembly of kings, &ldquo;I have brought twelve heads of cattle for the ceremony tonight&rdquo;. The others seem to shrink in stature as he speaks. The star of the king of Mutapa is clearly ascending. They have not brought nearly as much cattle themselves. &ldquo;Soon, we will all be praying to Obatala&rdquo;, murmurs one of the older Kilwa traders. &ldquo;The Mutapa will be raising their godless monuments sky-high. Perhaps it is time for us to resort to some magic of our own&rdquo;. Then the sky breaks into a thunder and a torrential rain pours down on the assembly. The men scramble while the plains fill with water. The ceremony will be wet tonight...&#10;&#10;&#10;The Great Zimbabwe is a logistico-economic game in which players are tribal leaders in Africa trying to please the gods by building monuments.&#10;&#10;Buying technology, building craftsmen, gathering resources and worshipping a god are among the many decisions necessary to win in 'The Great Zimbabwe'. But the main way of getting there is building and developing a network of monuments. The higher the monuments, the closer the players will be to victory, but players must balance many subtle aspects of the game. If they develop their economy, if they worship a powerful god or if they use a lot of technology, they will need to score more victory points.&#10;&#10;Clever use of turn-order manipulation, economic development in an almost close environment, scarce natural resource use and logistical optimization to deliver goods from craftsmen to monuments: You only get one action per turn, so be smart! 'The Great Zimbabwe' is a race for victory, in which you decide how far you want to go and at what speed. Then other players' decisions change everything...&#10;&#10;";5;150;14;2;90;The Great Zimbabwe;150;2012;Ynze Moedt;Civilization,Economic,Industry / Manufacturing,Transportation;Jeroen Doumen,Joris Wiersinga;Continent: Africa,Country: Zimbabwe;Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Modular Board,Route/Network Building,Tile Placement,Variable Player Powers;Splotter Spellen;7.7424;1568;the great zimbabwe;31;2.0;4.0;3.86;0;0.31;F5DMXSPtXY;False;0;5.0;150.0;14.0;2.0;120.0;The Great Zimbabwe;50;2-5;291;120-150;85.99;189.95;134.95;0.0;2220;2012.0;the great zimbabwe
686;7557;111799;"In December 1956, paroled rebel Fidel Castro returned to Cuba to launch his revolution with virtually no political base and&mdash;after a disastrous initial encounter with government forces&mdash;a total of just 12 men.  Two years later, through masterful propaganda and factional maneuver, Castro, his brother Ra&uacute;l, and iconic revolutionary Che Guevara had united disparate guerrillas and exploited Cubans&rsquo; deep opposition to their dictator Fulgencio Batista y Zald&iacute;var.  Castro&rsquo;s takeover of the country became a model for Leftist insurgency.&#10;&#10;Castro&rsquo;s Insurgency&#10;&#10;Following up on GMT Games&rsquo; Andean Abyss about insurgency in modern Colombia, the next volume in the COIN Series, Cuba Libre, takes 1 to 4 players into the Cuban Revolution.  Castro&rsquo;s &ldquo;26 July Movement&rdquo; must expand from its bases in the Sierra Maestra mountains to fight its way to Havana.  Meanwhile, anti-communist student groups, urban guerrillas, and expatriates try to de-stabilize the Batista regime from inside and out, while trying not to pave the way for a new dictatorship under Castro.  Batista&rsquo;s Government must maintain steam to counter the twin insurgency, while managing two benefactors:  its fragile US Alliance and its corrupting Syndicate skim.  And in the midst of the turmoil, Meyer Lansky and his Syndicate bosses will jockey to keep their Cuban gangster paradise alive.&#10;&#10;COIN Series, Volume II&#10;&#10;Cuba Libre will be easy to learn for Andean Abyss players&mdash;both volumes share the same innovative GMT COIN Series system.  Like Volume I, Cuba Libre is equally playable solitaire or by multiple players up to 4&mdash;and with a shorter time to completion than Andean Abyss.  But Cuba Libre&rsquo;s situation and strategic challenges will be new.  A deck of 48 fresh events brings 1950s Cuba to life and includes &hellip;&#10;&#10;&bull; The Twelve:  The first wave&rsquo;s escape to the Sierra Maestra&mdash;inspirational legend or harbinger of defeat?&#10;&bull; El Che and Ra&uacute;l:  Brilliant in the field, or bungling hostage-takers?&#10;&bull; Operation Fisherman:  Can the rebels pull off a second invasion?&#10;&bull; General Strike:  Urban disruption or rebel embarrassment?&#10;&bull; Radio Rebelde:  Are the masses tuning in, or just the Army direction finders?&#10;&bull; Pact of Caracas:  Can the rebels unite?&#10;&bull; Armored Cars:  Mobile striking power, but in whose hands?&#10;&bull; Rolando Masferrer:  Brutal pro-government tactics&mdash;will they help or hurt?&#10;&bull; Fat Butcher:  Can the Mob&rsquo;s enforcer protect its casinos?&#10;&bull; Sinatra:  Frankie&rsquo;s Havana show a boom or bust, and who collects?&#10;&hellip; and much more.&#10;&#10;New twists match the COIN Series system to the situation in 1950s Cuba:&#10;&#10;&bull; It&rsquo;s the insurgents who build lasting capabilities, while the Government is limited to fleeting bursts of momentum.&#10;&bull; The Syndicate&rsquo;s bases are Casinos&mdash;expensive to build, but so important to Cuba no army will destroy them.  &#10;&bull; Syndicate special activities include calling in the &ldquo;muscle&rdquo; of Government troops and police to protect mob assets.  &#10;&bull; Stacks of Syndicate cash awaiting launder can fall in anyone&rsquo;s hands&mdash;even the corrupt Government&rsquo;s.&#10;&bull; The Government has its own terror tactic&mdash;reprisals&mdash;and can skim a portion of Syndicate profits.&#10;&bull; The eroding US Alliance with Batista overshadows all Government actions, not just through aid levels but also through the day-to-day ability of troops and police to operate.&#10;&bull; Even if Batista flees, the struggle may not end&mdash;the counterrevolutionary government may even become stronger!&#10;&#10;Multiplayer, 2-Player, Solitaire&#10;&#10;Cuba Libre provides up to 4 players with contrasting roles and overlapping victory conditions for rich diplomatic interaction. For 2- or 3-player games, players can represent alliances of factions, or the game system can control non-player factions . Or a single player as the Cuban Revolutionaries can attempt to topple Batista and seize power for themselves. The non-player sides will fight one another as well as the players, but too much power in the hands of any one of them will mean player defeat.&#10;&#10;More COIN Series Volumes to Come&#10;&#10;Andean Abyss and now Cuba Libre present a game system on modern insurgency readily adaptable to other conflicts, particularly those featuring the interaction of many sides (thus the name COunterINsurgency Series). A rich and under-represented history of guerrilla warfare beckons, as modern insurgency offers virtually unlimited, under-gamed topics for the COIN Series.  Volume III is A Distant Plain&#226;&#128;&#148;Insurgency in Afghanistan.  Volume IV is Fire in the Lake&#226;&#128;&#148;Insurgency in Vietnam.&#10;&#10;";4;180;0;1;180;Cuba Libre;180;2013;Xavier Carrascosa,Rodger B.

688;7576;112869;"Munchkin Apocalypse is a core set in the Munchkin series with an end of the world theme that includes natural disasters, zombie takeovers, Armageddon, alien invasions, nuclear war, etc. And while this is still a standard Munchkin game where you try to level up by killing the monsters, stealing the treasure, and stabbing your buddy, there's a new &quot;Seal&quot; mechanic that significantly changes the gameplay.&#10;&#10;Seals are a reference to the biblical seals of the Apocalypse. They can be opened and closed, although it's typically more difficult to close them. Once seven Seals are open, the game ends immediately, and the player with the highest combat strength (excluding levels) is the winner. The Seal mechanic adds a sense of impending doom to the game, meant to mimic the sense of impending doom for a real apocalypse. It also tends to create situations where the group works together to close a Seal in order to prevent a player from winning via the Seal mechanic. So there is more teamwork than in a regular Munchkin game.&#10;&#10;The balance of the deck is also different than the other Munchkin sets. There are a lot more Disaster cards, which are equivalent to traps and curses, so bad things tend to occur more frequently. Also, there are more monsters, especially high-level monsters. To offset this, however, there are more item enhancers and high-bonus items. It's been stated in the Munchkin forums that Munchkin Apocalypse is harder to play and is intended more for seasoned Munchkin veterans.&#10;&#10;Munchkin Apocalypse has four new classes but does not have races, powers, or other &quot;thingies&quot;. It includes Undead and Shark monsters, which follow special rules.&#10;&#10;The game comes with 180 cards (92 Doors, 76 Treasures, 12 Seals). The Seal cards are a different size than the regular cards--they're square and are shorter but wider (2.75&quot; x 2.75&quot;). The included d6 is orange with lime green pips, similar in color to the orange dice in the +6 Bag o' Radioactive Munchkin d6.&#10;&#10;";6;90;10;3;90;Munchkin Apocalypse;90;2012;John Kovalic,Ethan Nicolle,Len Peralta,Gabby Ruenes;Card Game,Fighting,Humor;Steve Jackson (I);Munchkin;Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Variable Player Powers;Black Monk,Edge Entertainment,Hobby World,Kaissa Chess & Games,Pegasus Spiele,Raven Distribution,Steve Jackson Games;6.6219;826;munchkin apocalypse;52;0.0;0.0;3.05982905982906;0;0.36;oF2117akpQ;False;0;6.0;90.0;10.0;3.0;90.0;Munchkin Apocalypse;15;3-6;5;90;16.0;36.52;32.95;16.99;139;2012.0;munchkin apocalypse

690;7582;113294;"Escape: The Curse of the Temple is a cooperative game in which players must escape (yes...) from a temple (yes...) which is cursed (yes...) before the temple collapses and kills one or more explorers, thereby causing everyone to lose.&#10;&#10;The initial game board consists of a row of three square tiles, each showing a combination of two symbols, say, two green adventurers or one green adventurer and one blue key in one corner of the tile. All of the explorers start in the center tile &ndash; the safe room &ndash; and each player starts with a hand of five dice. Each die has five symbols:&#10;&#10;&#10;    A cursed mask &ndash; this die is set aside when rolled.&#10;    A golden mask &ndash; each such symbol counteracts two cursed masks, either your own or those of another explorer in the same room.&#10;    A red torch or blue key &ndash; these are used to enter rooms, access treasure, or activate gems.&#10;    A green adventurer, which appears twice on the die &ndash; you need these to move from room to room, and to activate some gems.&#10;&#10;&#10;Escape is played in real-time, with all players rolling dice and taking actions simultaneously. You must roll the right symbols to enter a room, and if you're at an open doorway, you can roll to reveal the next tile in the stack and add it to that doorway. Some rooms contain combinations of red and blue symbols, and if you (possibly working with other players in the same room) roll enough red or blue symbols, you &quot;discover&quot; magic gems, moving them from a separate gem depot onto that tile.&#10;&#10;The real-time aspect is enforced by a soundtrack to be played during the game. At certain points, a countdown starts, and if players aren't back in the safe room when time is up, they lose one of their dice.&#10;&#10;Once the exit tile is revealed, players can attempt to escape the temple by moving to that tile, then rolling a number of blue dice equal to the magic gems that haven't been removed from the gem depot. Thus, the more gems you find, the easier it is to escape the temple. When a player escapes, he gives one die to a player of his choice. If all players escape before the third countdown, everyone wins; if not, everyone loses, no matter how many players did escape.&#10;&#10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple includes two expansion modules that can be used individually or together. With the &quot;Treasures&quot; module, some rooms contain treasure, and when you reveal such a room, you place a face-down treasure chest on the tile. Roll the symbols on that chest tile, and you claim the treasure for use later: a key lets you teleport anywhere, a path lets you connect two rooms that otherwise have no door between them, and a medic kit heals all players instantly (putting black dice back into play). With the &quot;Curses&quot; module, some tiles &quot;curse&quot; players by forcing them to place one hand on their head, keep mute during play, or otherwise do what you wouldn't want to do while escaping a temple!&#10;&#10;";5;10;8;1;10;Escape: The Curse of the Temple;10;2012;Oliver Schlemmer;Adventure,Dice,Electronic,Exploration,Real-time;Kristian Amundsen Østby;Archaeology,CD Board Games,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Queen Games Escape Series,Queen Yellow Wave Box Series,Solitaire Games;Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Grid Movement,Modular Board,Tile Placement;Queen Games,REBEL.pl;7.1032899999999985;11469;escape: the curse of the temple;25;0.0;0.0;3.3989263257575755;0;-0.04;kbQ7WwkwRW;False;0;5.0;15.0;8.0;1.0;10.0;Escape: The Curse of the Temple;240;1-5;1559;10-15;42.99;72.99;47.99;0.0;1726;2012.0;escape: the curse of the temple

The Metagame gives you a chance to exercise your smartest and most ridiculous opinions on just about everything: music and movies, fine art and fashion, junk food and videogames. It&rsquo;s a card game where you do what you already love to do with your friends: talk about culture. There&rsquo;s not just one way to play - The Metagame comes with six unique games. Each one makes use of both types of cards in The Metagame deck:&#10;&#10;&#10;     CULTURE CARDS feature a single cultural object or icon, from the Mona Lisa to Ms. Pac-Man.&#10;     OPINION CARDS say things like &ldquo;Which feels like first love?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Best reminder of our mortality.&rdquo;&#10;&#10;&#10;Some of the games get you debating, and some are more strategic.

The Metagame covers every possible kind of design, media, and art and helps you see culture in new ways.

695;7611;115105;"From the Designers:&#10;You are twisted.  I can&rsquo;t believe you actually want to put these adorable kittens in a blender! I guess that&rsquo;s none of my business. Maybe you&rsquo;re more of a dog person. Sure, kittens are curious by nature, but when they get in a kitchen full of dangerous appliances, it is up to you to save them.&#10;&#10;This fast-paced card game has players working to save all of their own kittens before the unthinkable happens. But sometimes the only way to save your precious litter of kittens is to let those curious little cats learn the lesson of why you should never play in a Blender!&#10;&#10;According to the box: A portion of the proceeds will be donated to a no kill cat shelter.&#10;&#10;Objective:&#10;Save your kittens and send your opponents' kittens to The Blender.&#10;&#10;Setup &amp; Play:&#10;Put the game box top on the table, open-side up and place the oversized Blender card inside, face-up: that's The Blender. Place the oversized Box card face up in the base of the box: that's The Box. Leave a little space between The Blender and The Box: that's The Counter.  Assign each player a Kitten color (red, green, blue or yellow), shuffle the deck, deal each player 6 cards and it's time to start saving adventurous kittens.&#10;&#10;On each turn, players play two cards and then draw back up to 6. Kitten cards may be played into The Blender, The Counter or The Box.  All other cards are played face up in front of the player so that all players can see which cards have been played.&#10;&#10;Players can play Kitties on the Move to move kittens to or from The Blender, The Counter or The Box; the number on the card specifies the number of kittens that can each be moved 1 space. Playing a Blend card will destroy the kittens currently in The Blender, save the kittens in The Box, and move the kittens on The Counter into The Blender unless countered by another player's Blend &quot;Pulse&quot; card.&#10;&#10;Players can move kittens around with other cards as well. Kittens in the Blender moves all of the kittens on The Counter or in The Box to The Blender. With These Cats in the Blender a player can move all cats of a chosen color from The Counter and The Box to The Blender. Kittens in the Box moves all kittens in The Blender or on The Counter to The Box, while Cats on the Counter moves all the kittens in The Blender or The Box to The Counter.&#10;&#10;Total chaos reigns when the Dog's in the Kitchen as each player gives her hand to the player in the direction indicated on the card.&#10;&#10;The game ends when all 16 of the Blend cards have been played.

696;7627;116954;"Indigo is a tile-laying game along the lines of Metro, Tsuro, and Linie 1 in which players build paths bit by bit, with no player owning the individual paths and everyone trying to exploit the paths already present. Unlike those earlier games, however, your goal is to move gemstones from their starting locations on the board to your designated goals, with the player who scores the most points winning the game.&#10;&#10;To set up the game board, place the central hex tile, then add five green gems and one indigo gem to it. Place six &quot;U-turn&quot; tiles at their designated locations on the outer edge of the game board, then place a yellow gem on each such tile. Each player places goal markers on goals between these U-turn tiles on the edge of the game board: in a two-player game, the players alternate goals; in a three-player game, each player has one goal to herself, while sharing two others; and in a four-player game, each player shares a goal with every other player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player places a tile on any space on the game board, with the only restriction being that a player cannot create a route directly from one goal to another. Each tile has three route segments on it, connecting one pair of edges. If a player places a tile next to a gemstone, that gemstone &quot;moves&quot; as far as possible along the route so that all players can see where to place tiles to next move that gemstone. (Thus players avoid the mental gymnastics required in Metro and Linie 1 in which nothing moves until a route is complete.) When connecting to the central tile, the green gems move off first, with the indigo gem moving only with the sixth connection.&#10;&#10;If a player places a tile so that one gem would run into another, both gems are removed from the game!&#10;&#10;When a gem is moved to a goal owned by only one player, that player keeps the gem. If two players own the goal, then both players collect a gem of that color, taking the extra gem needed from the reserve. Once all the gems have been claimed, the game ends, with players earning 3 points for an indigo gem, 2 for green, and 1 for yellow. The player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;";4;30;8;2;30;Indigo;30;2012;Eckhard Freytag,Walter Pepperle;Abstract Strategy;Reiner Knizia;;Point to Point Movement,Route/Network Building,Tile Placement;Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH;6.85623;1906;indigo;35;0.0;0.0;3.3965116279069765;0;0.0;bcHVwsjSOJ;True;0;4.0;30.0;8.0;2.0;30.0;Indigo;43;2-4;292;30;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;1131;2012.0;indigo

Who doesn't love schadenfreude? (Well, other than those being schadened, I suppose...)&#10;&#10;In more detail, Las Vegas includes six cardboard casino mats, one for each side of a normal six-sided die. For each mat, players draw money cards until at least $50k is showing, but the amount may end up being a lot more, making that casino more desirable.&#10;&#10;Each player has eight dice of a different color, which they take turns rolling. When you roll your dice, you can choose to place them on the relevant casino cards; for example, a die showing a 1 will be placed on the casino mat marked &quot;1&quot;. You must place all dice of one number on one casino in your turn. All players take turns doing this until all the dice have been used. Finally, the player with the most dice on each casino card takes the money associated with it. In case of a tie, the next non-tied player takes the highest-valued money card at that casino.&#10;&#10;Las Vegas rates a 1 out of 10 on alea's difficulty scale.&#10;&#10;";5;30;8;2;30;Las Vegas;30;2012;Harald Lieske,Markus Schmuck,Mia Steingräber;Dice;Rüdiger Dorn;Alea Medium Box,Cities: Las Vegas (Nevada, USA);Area Control / Area Influence,Dice Rolling;alea,Oya,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH;7.06833;4939;las vegas;28;0.0;0.0;3.4870370370370365;0;0.0;tAVKBpUzgB;False;0;5.0;45.0;8.0;2.0;30.0;Las Vegas;135;2-5;1518;30-45;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;1020;2012.0;las vegas
700;7655;118048;"Theme and overview:&#10;&#10;Unlike in other cultures, the desert Tuareg men, known as Targi, cover their faces whereas women of the tribe do not wear veils. They run the household and they have the last word at home in the tents. Different families are divided into tribes, headed by the &lsquo;Imascheren&rsquo; (or nobles). As leader of a Tuareg tribe, players trade goods from near (such as dates and salt) and far (like pepper), in order to obtain gold and other benefits, and enlarge their family. In each round there new offerings are made. Cards are a means to an end, in order to obtain the popular tribe cards.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;The board consists of a 5x5 grid: a border of 16 squares with printed action symbols and then 9 blank squares in the centre onto which cards are dealt. Meeples are placed one at a time on the spaces at the edges of the board (not including corner squares). You cannot place a meeple on a square the opponent has a meeple on already, nor on a square facing opponent's meeple. Once all meeples are placed, players then execute the actions on the border squares the meeples are on and also take the cards from the centre that match the row and column of the border meeples.&#10;&#10;The game is predominantly scored and won by playing tribal cards to your display. These give advantages during the game and victory points at the end. Usually cards are played (or discarded) immediately once drawn. A single card can be kept in hand but then requires a special action to play it (or to discard it to free the hand spot for another card). Each card has a cost in goods to play. Goods are obtained either from border spaces or from goods cards.&#10;&#10;The display (for scoring) consists of 3 rows of 4 cards that are filled from left to right and cannot be moved once placed (barring some special cards). There is also a balance to be found between the victory point score on the cards themselves (1-3 VP per tribal card) and in the combinations per row (a full row of 4 identical card types gets you an additional 4 VP, and a full row of 4 distinct card types gets you 2 VP).&#10;&#10;The winner at the end of the game is the player with the most victory points.&#10;&#10;";2;60;12;2;60;Targi;60;2012;Franz Vohwinkel;Arabian,Card Game;Andreas Steiger;Continent: Africa,Desert Theme,Kosmos two-player series;Modular Board,Set Collection,Worker Placement;999 Games,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Giochi Uniti,Group SNE,Kaissa Chess & Games,KOSMOS,Stupor Mundi,Z-Man Games;7.621010000000001;6012;targi;7;2.0;2.5;3.901977777777776;0;0.3;Yzurao9vqw;False;8;2.0;75.0;12.0;2.0;60.0;Targi;225;2;1550;60-75;13.99;29.99;16.74;14.79;5887;2012.0;targi

702;7675;118536;"Police Precinct is a cooperative/semi-cooperative game where players are tasked with solving a mysterious murder while simultaneously working to keep crime on the streets under control, and to keep the city from falling into chaos.&#10;&#10;Players take on the role of police officers with different areas of expertise.  The players work together to solve the mystery by collecting evidence and eventually arresting the suspect.&#10;&#10;Complicating matters is the fact that there may or may not be a corrupt officer that is being paid off by the murderer to suppress evidence, the same evidence everyone else is trying to uncover.&#10;&#10;Players move around the city searching through randomly shuffled investigation cards for evidence in relation to the murder.  The number of investigation cards drawn depends on the character&rsquo;s rating as well as how many player cards are added by other players to boost the character&rsquo;s rating for the current &ldquo;search&rdquo;.  There are four decks of investigation cards (Interview Witness, Collect Crime Scene Evidence, Examine Body and Locate Murder Weapon) to be searched.  These decks are shuffled and placed in different locations.  So, a player might search the cards in one area and not find any evidence at all&hellip; or maybe the bribed cop, if there is one, did the searching and just said no evidence was found.&#10;&#10;Players have to find all of the evidence cards from the investigation decks to be able to arrest the murderer.&#10;&#10;At the end of each player&rsquo;s turn they draw an event card.  These cards represent growing crime and emergencies that are happening in the city.  Each one piles on top of the other, and if the cops don't stay on top of things, they will be buried in crime!  These Event cards are placed on the game board at the locations where they occur.  Some of them have &ldquo;unknown circumstance&rdquo; tokens placed face-down upon them, adding even more tension.&#10;&#10;If too many criminals are located in one area, a gang is formed.  Each gang has its own power and can cripple the police efforts if not handled quickly and carefully.&#10;&#10;So, not only are the players investigating the murder, but they must also arrest street criminals and handle emergencies.&#10;&#10;Sometimes when a character successfully completes a task, that character is rewarded with a doughnut token.  These tokens can later be used to help with tasks.  However, if the character does not complete the task in time, the city crime track advances.  The track can also advance if street crimes grow so large that no more street criminals can be placed, when called for.  If the Crime Track advances to the end, the murderer escapes justice and the good cops fail the game.&#10;&#10;To add to the tension even further, The good cops only have so many days to complete the investigation.  If time runs out, once again the murderer shall escape justice!&#10;&#10;The pressure is great and the stakes are high!&#10;&#10;";6;90;13;1;90;Police Precinct;90;2013;George Patsouras,Marco Primo;Bluffing,Deduction,Murder/Mystery,Negotiation;Ole Steiness;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Solitaire Games;Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Point to Point Movement,Variable Player Powers;Common Man Games;7.0360000000000005;1231;police precinct;62;0.0;0.0;3.397903225806452;0;0.0;tdCbJiAkyX;False;0;6.0;90.0;13.0;1.0;90.0;Police Precinct;31;1-6;200;90;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;381;2013.0;police precinct

Fortunately, being a peaceful people you have chosen not to fight over what little there is. Instead, you set out in your seagoing Wa&rsquo;a (canoe) to fish and gather crops from the many nearby islands. The fertility goddess Haumea has blessed these islands, and they are rich with fruits, vegetables, and spices. It is a matter of pride to collect the finest harvest for the village. Can you win the race against time and the sea, and prove that you are the best gatherer of all?&#10;&#10;In Tahiti the goal is to collect crops (coconuts, taro, bananas, spice) and fish from the surrounding islands to score points with bonuses for making full sets and acquiring the most of their family favorites which are hidden from the other players.&#10;&#10;The game starts off with just your home island and its immediate neighboring islands. Players build up the archipelago of fertile islands with the guidance of Haumea for the first part of the game until all islands are in play. Players seed the islands each turn giving them some control over where crops replenish. Once the archipelago is formed, the late season is triggered when crops start becoming scarce, with players occasionally stopping an island from producing altogether. Although the late season may not be as good for crops, fishing becomes easier with bonuses given to the waters around some of the islands.&#10; During all this the players travel by Wa&rsquo;a from island to island using action points to collect the crops they want or can get to before the others take them. As the Wa&rsquo;a fills, it becomes slower limiting the number of actions they have. There are also treacherous reefs around the islands that require you go around them or risk losing some of the crops aboard your Wa&rsquo;a.

A card shows one of six specific characters (Architect, Merchant, etc.) or is a wild card.&#10;&#10;Phase 2 consists of six sub-phases in a fixed order, one for each character. In each sub-phase, players choose whether or not to play one or more cards of that specific character. Each card allows them to perfom that character's action, for example:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take one piece of gold for each Merchant card you play.&#10;     Place one council member into the current district for each Council card you play.&#10;     Take a building with a value equal to or lower than the number of Architect cards played. The higher its value, the better its function.&#10;&#10;&#10;Whoever plays the most cards in each such sub-phase receives a bonus of one free action of that type. In case of a tie, whoever is farthest along the &quot;Doge&quot; bar gets the bonus &ndash; and of course to advance on the Doge bar, players need to play Doge cards.&#10;&#10;Finally, in phase 3, players may take advantage of their buildings. For each piece of gold paid, a player may use one of his building's ability.&#10;&#10;Players collect VPs both during the game &ndash; from special buildings and by building bridges between districts &ndash; and at the end of it &ndash; for majorities of council members in each district. The value of each district evolves during the game: Each district is adjacent to four other ones, and at the end of the game, they will be connected either via bridges or gondolas. A bridge increases the value of the adjacent districts by 3-6 victory points, whereas a gondola increases this value by 1 point. The player with the most council members in a district earns VPs equal to the district's total value, the player with the secondmost council members earns half this value, and so on. While it's important to establish majorities in the districts, it's also crucial to control their values by cleverly placing those bridges and gondolas.&#10;&#10;";5;45;10;2;45;Rialto;45;2013;Andreas Resch,Hans-Georg Schneider;Political,Renaissance;Stefan Feld;Cities: Venice,Country: Italy;Area Control / Area Influence,Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting;Pegasus Spiele,Ludonova,REBEL.pl,Tasty Minstrel Games;6.98837;2955;rialto;32;0.0;0.0;3.1841463414634137;0;0.0;hfr84CjVp7;True;0;5.0;45.0;10.0;2.0;45.0;Rialto;41;2-5;117;45;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;449;2013.0;rialto
707;7707;119788;"The mythical realm of Hyperborea was ruled by an ancient civilization that used magical crystals as their main source of energy. With time, the Hyperboreans became greedy, and their search for power in the deep made the crystals unstable, causing earthquakes, mutations, droughts and floods. Hyperboreans just dug deeper, and only a few wise mages, foreseeing the inevitable, built an unbreakable magical barrier. When the unharnessed magical energy was unleashed from the deep, the Hyperborean civilization was destroyed in a single day, only the magical barrier preventing the disappearance of life from the whole land. The survivors living in the small outposts outside Hyperborea were now sealed out by the barrier. The knowledge of crystals was declared forbidden it was because too dangerous, or simply forgotten.&#10;&#10;Over centuries, six rival realms were born from the ashes of the Hyperborean civilization: the militarist Red Duchy; the Emerald Kingdom and its death-delivering archers; the Purple Matriarchy fanatically worshipping the goddess of life; the skilled diplomats and merchants of the Golden Barony; the Coral Throne with its efficiently organized society and finally the secluded and enigmatic Celestial Reign.&#10;&#10;The fragile peace between the different realms was not intended to last. One day, the magical barrier suddenly collapsed. A whole new land stood in front of the six kingdoms, still haunted by the old Hyperboreans turned into harmless but ominous ghosts, full of ruins to discover and cities to explore. Each realm is now sending its best warriors and explorers to Hyperborea in order to achieve dominance over their rivals, but which will prevail? Brutal strength or deep understanding of science? The discovery of valuable artifacts in the lost ruins or the retaking of long, lost cities? Only you, as the leader of one of the factions, can lead your people to the ultimate dominance over Hyperborea!&#10;&#10;Set in a mythical land of the same name, Hyperborea is a light civilization game for 2 to 6 players that takes 20-25 minutes per player. The game begins at the time when the magic barrier protecting access to the mythical continent of Hyperborea suddenly falls.&#10;&#10;Each player takes the role of the leader of a small kingdom situated just outside the now open to be conquered and explored land. Her kingdom has limited knowledge of housing, trade, movement, warfare, research, and growth, but new and exciting powers are hidden in Hyperborea. During the game, this kingdom will grow in numbers and raise armies, extend its territory, explore and conquer, learn new technologies, etc...&#10;&#10;The game's main mechanism, which can be described as &quot;bag-building&quot;, involves you building a pool of &quot;civilicubes&quot;. Each cube represents specializations for your kingdom: war, trade, movement, building, knowledge, growth. Grey cubes represent corruption and waste, and players will acquire them by developing new technologies. (Power corrupts by its own definition, and the more complex a society becomes, the more waste it generates.) Each turn, players draw three random cubes from their bags, then use them to activate knowledge (technologies) they own.&#10;&#10;";6;90;12;2;90;Hyperborea;90;2014;Miguel Coimbra,Fabio Gorla,Federico Musetti,Roberto Pitturru;Civilization,Exploration,Fighting;Andrea Chiarvesio,Pierluca Zizzi;Components: Miniatures;Area Control / Area Influence,Deck / Pool Building,Grid Movement,Modular Board,Variable Player Powers;Asterion Press,Asmodee,Marabunta,Yemaia;7.327369999999998;2741;hyperborea;35;0.0;0.0;3.41024193548387;0;0.0;B5VE7YWfbB;False;0;5.0;120.0;12.0;2.0;90.0;Hyperborea;62;2-5;200;90-120;49.95;99.99;114.95;0.0;1139;2014.0;hyperborea

Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft, the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that, each group has special skills and abilities.&#10;&#10;Taking turns, the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability, and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. The groups in question, along with their home landscape, are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Desert (Fakirs, Nomads)&#10;    Plains (Halflings, Cultists)&#10;    Swamp (Alchemists, Darklings)&#10;    Lake (Mermaids, Swarmlings)&#10;    Forest (Witches, Auren)&#10;    Mountain (Dwarves, Engineers)&#10;    Wasteland (Giants, Chaos Magicians)&#10;&#10;&#10;Proximity to other groups is a double-edged sword in Terra Mystica.

Each other player then chooses one card in her own hand and gives it to the Storyteller in secret. These cards are shuffled and revealed, then players vote on which card was played by the Storyteller.&#10;&#10;If no one or everyone votes for the Storyteller, then he receives no points; if he received some votes but not all the votes, he scores based on the number of votes received.

717;7755;121958;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Command your own skyship and become a master merchant in Sky Traders, a board game of commerce and intrigue for two to five players. Evade the ruthless Wind Pirates as you collect influence with the powerful Sky Guild. Manipulate the commodity market using your powers of persuasion. Through clever trades and resourceful captaining, you can seize the title of Master of the Sky Guild!&#10;&#10;Each round of Sky Traders takes place in two main phases. In the first phase, players sail their ships and perform actions. To start, each player draws an Ill Wind card, which has a variety of effects that can help or hinder players. The Sky Patrol could attack you for carrying contraband, or the Wind Pirates might try to board your vessel in hopes of plundering valuable goods. If you're lucky, you'll stumble upon a treasure map that leads to riches. It's all up to fate when you draw from the Ill Wind deck.&#10;&#10;You'll add new members to your crew to gain various improvements. Skymen lend their blades to fight off Wind Pirate attacks. Other shipmates can help you earn more money when selling goods. Some crewmembers even make it possible to disregard the results of an Ill Wind card. You'll want to be judicious when hiring crew since they take up valuable space on the ship that could be used for trade goods.&#10;&#10;If your skyship requires repairs or refueling, visit a city. While there, line the ship's cargo hold with valuable textiles, spices, or even jewels, then deliver the goods to another city where entrepreneurs will pay large sums of money for the items. Make sure to stock up on goods when the price is low and sell them off when their value increases.&#10;&#10;In the second phase of each turn, the Guild Council takes place. During this round, players deliberate with each other in hopes of persuading their peers to help influence the price of goods. Strike a deal with your peers and you could force a surge in the value of the commodities you own, but if you've angered your rivals, they may choose to team up and devalue the wares you are selling.&#10;&#10;At the end of the Guild Council phase, each captain also has the opportunity to purchase Influence, which increases his ability to control prices and moves him a step closer to victory. Influence is expensive, but you cannot become the Master of the Sky Guild without it.&#10;&#10;As captain of your own skyship, you'll have to decide each turn how to best service your needs. Buying cargo at one port and delivering it to another city where the goods are highly desired is a great way to turn a profit. However, a captain also must consider hiring new crew, checking the ship&rsquo;s phlogiston (fuel for skyships) levels, repairing damage sustained in pirate attacks, and undertaking other important tasks to keep the ship running at peak performance. When money is tight, haul toxic sludge or collect minerals from the countryside to make some quick money.&#10;&#10;FAQ &amp; ERRATA: http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=3532&#10;&#10;";5;180;14;2;180;Sky Traders;180;2012;Miguel Coimbra,Nicolas Fructus,Christophe Madura;Aviation / Flight,Fantasy,Transportation;Gioacchino Prestigiacomo;Steampunk;Area Movement,Commodity Speculation,Dice Rolling,Modular Board,Pick-up and Deliver;Dust Games,Edge Entertainment,Fantasy Flight Games;6.23957;508;sky traders;93;0.0;0.0;2.666666666666667;0;0.0;szrwpQq5Lw;False;0;5.0;180.0;14.0;2.0;180.0;Sky Traders;6;2-5;12;180;49.95;0.0;49.99;0.0;194;2012.0;sky traders

Play with a friend while you're waiting for the bus or invite a group over for a game night.  It's small size and varying options for length of game play make it perfect for any occasion.&#10;&#10;Object: &#10;&#10;     To say an English word with the same first letter as the depicted image on the card before your opponent. The player with the most cards at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Playing the Game:&#10;&#10;     Choose one player to start as the &lsquo;Blurbler&rsquo; (the person who starts the action by flipping a card onto the table). The Blurbler takes a small stack of cards, without looking at the images, and adds more to the stack as necessary.&#10;     Play starts between the Blurbler and the player to his or her left.&#10;     The Blurbler flips the first card from the stack face-up onto the table. The card should be placed at an equal distance between the two players. Each time a card is flipped, a &lsquo;face-off&rsquo; occurs between the Blurbler and the opponent.&#10;     The two players involved race to say any English word, that is not a proper noun or a number, that shares the same first letter as the object on the card. For instance, if the card shows a dog, words such as &ldquo;drain&rdquo; or &ldquo;dairy&rdquo; would be acceptable, whereas &ldquo;David&rdquo; or &ldquo;Denmark&rdquo; would not. Words used must be at least three letters long.&#10;     The first player to finish saying a correct word first is the winner.&#10;     The Blurbler continues to move clockwise around the circle until beat.&#10;     Once the Blurbler is beat, the deck is passed to the player who won that round, and a new Blurbler is born.&#10;     Play always resumes with the player to the left of the new Blurbler.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Scoring:&#10;&#10;     The player who says a legal word first is the winner of that face-off.&#10;     After each face-off, the winning player takes the card and puts it in front of him or her.&#10;     If there is uncertainty about who said the word first, the other players not involved will vote on who won. If the round is deemed a tie, neither player is awarded the card, and the two players will face-off again with the next card.&#10;     A word may only be said once in a given sitting.  Let&rsquo;s say the octopus card is flipped.  One player yells &ldquo;orange&rdquo; and the other yells &ldquo;oblong&rdquo;.  If &ldquo;orange&rdquo; was said before &ldquo;oblong&rdquo;, then &ldquo;orange&rdquo; cannot be used for the duration of the game, but &ldquo;oblong&rdquo; is still allowed.  If there is uncertainty whether a word has already been said, consult the rest of the table for a group vote.  A redo card can be used to resolve any disputes.&#10;     If an incorrect word is used, for instance a proper noun, a number, a two-letter word, or a word that has already been used, players may continue to shout words until someone says a correct one. There is no penalty for incorrect words.&#10;     A word may not be used if its exact spelling is contained within the depicted image. For instance, &ldquo;rain&rdquo; could not be used for &ldquo;rainbow,&rdquo; or &ldquo;rob&rdquo; for &ldquo;robot.&rdquo; Similarly, if a word is pronounced the same, but has a different spelling, it cannot be used. In the example above, &ldquo;reign&rdquo; could not be used for &ldquo;rainbow.&rdquo; A word with a similar sound is acceptable, so long as it is not spelled out in the depicted image. For instance, &ldquo;row&rdquo; could be used for &ldquo;rope&rdquo; or &ldquo;camel&rdquo; for &ldquo;camera.&rdquo;&#10;     The player with the most cards at the end of the game is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Winning the Game:&#10;There are several different options of how to structure the game. In all options, the winning player of each face-off keeps that card. These options allow you to structure how long game play will last.&#10;&#10;     Decide on how long to play and set a timer. When the timer sounds, players add up their cards to determine the winner.&#10;     Play to a predetermined number. Once someone has accumulated the predetermined number of cards, he or she is the winner.&#10;     Decide on how many cards will constitute a game.  This can be done by simply grabbing a smaller stack from the deck, or counting out an exact number.  Play until all the cards are gone.  The player who collected the most cards is the winner.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";12;30;6;2;30;Blurble;30;2013;Erin Koehler;Children's Game,Party Game,Word Game;Grant Bernard;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter;Pattern Recognition;Bernard Games L.L.C.;6.34909;55;blurble;37;0.0;0.0;2.625;0;-2.24;liCaJZNraK;False;0;8.0;15.0;8.0;4.0;15.0;Blurble;4;4-8;23;15;64.71;0.0;17.07;0.0;185;2013.0;blurble

720;7763;122298;"The woods are old-growth, dappled with sunlight. Delicious mushrooms beckon from every grove and hollow. Morels may be the most sought-after in these woods, but there are many tasty and valuable varieties awaiting the savvy collector. Bring a basket if you think it's your lucky day. Forage at night and you will be all alone when you stumble upon a bonanza. If you're hungry, put a pan on the fire and bask in the aroma of chanterelles as you saut&eacute; them in butter. Feeling mercantile? Sell porcini to local aficionados for information that will help you find what you seek deep in the forest.&#10;&#10;Morels, a strategic card game for two players, uses two decks: a Day Deck (84 cards) that includes ten different types of mushrooms as well as baskets, cider, butter, pans, and moons; and a smaller Night Deck (8 cards) of mushrooms to be foraged by moonlight. Each mushroom card has two values: one for selling and one for cooking. Selling two or more like mushrooms grants foraging sticks that expand your options in the forest (that is, the running tableau of eight face-up cards on the table), enabling offensive or defensive plays that change with every game played. Cooking sets of three or more like mushrooms &ndash; sizzling in butter or cider if the set is large enough &ndash; earns points toward winning the game. With poisonous mushrooms wielding their wrath and a hand-size limit to manage, card selection is a tricky proposition at every turn.&#10;&#10;Following each turn, one card from the forest moves into a decay pile that is available for only a short time. The Day Deck then refills the forest from the back, creating the effect of a walk in the woods in which some strategic morsels are collected, some are passed by, and others lay ahead.&#10;&#10;";2;30;10;2;30;Morels;30;2012;Vince Dorse,Jarek Nocoń;Card Game,Educational;Brent Povis;Food / Cooking,Mushrooms;Card Drafting,Hand Management,Memory,Set Collection;HomoLudicus,Pegasus Spiele,REBEL.pl,Two Lanterns Games;7.085660000000002;4432;morels;2;0.0;0.0;3.3584821428571434;0;-0.08;XVYVL4fQcm;False;0;2.0;30.0;10.0;2.0;30.0;Morels;112;2;590;30;26.95;0.0;23.99;0.0;1120;2012.0;morels
721;7768;122515;"Keyflower is a game for two to six players played over four rounds. Each round represents a season: spring, summer, autumn, and finally winter. Each player starts the game with a &quot;home&quot; tile and an initial team of eight workers, each of which is colored red, yellow, or blue. Workers of matching colors are used by the players to bid for tiles to add to their villages. Matching workers may alternatively be used to generate resources, skills and additional workers, not only from the player's own tiles, but also from the tiles in the other players' villages and from the new tiles being auctioned.&#10;&#10;In spring, summer and autumn, more workers will arrive on board the Keyflower and her sister boats, with some of these workers possessing skills in the working of the key resources of iron, stone and wood. In each of these seasons, village tiles are set out at random for auction. In the winter no new workers arrive and the players select the village tiles for auction from those they received at the beginning of the game. Each winter village tile offers VPs for certain combinations of resources, skills and workers. The player whose village and workers generate the most VPs wins the game.&#10;&#10;Keyflower presents players with many different challenges and each game will be different due to the mix of village tiles that appear in that particular game. Throughout the game, players will need to be alert to the opportunities to best utilize their various resources, transport and upgrade capability, skills and workers.&#10;&#10;Keyflower, a joint design between Richard Breese and Sebastian Bleasdale, is the seventh game in the &quot;Key&quot; series from R&amp;D Games set in the medieval &quot;Key&quot; land.&#10;&#10;";6;120;12;2;90;Keyflower;120;2012;Juliet Breese,Jo Breese,Gemma Tegelaers;City Building,Economic,Nautical,Renaissance,Territory Building;Sebastian Bleasdale,Richard Breese;Colonial Theme,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Key-series,Keyflower,Quined Master Print Edition Series;Auction/Bidding,Memory,Modular Board,Pick-up and Deliver,Route/Network Building,Set Collection,Tile Placement,Worker Placement;R&D Games,Czacha Games,Ediciones MasQueOca,FoxMind,Game Harbor,Game Salute,Gigamic,HUCH! & friends,Quined Games;7.94075;11717;keyflower;22;0.0;0.0;3.8768924302788834;0;-0.08;lDg8hjuvRb;False;13;6.0;120.0;12.0;2.0;90.0;Keyflower;251;2-6;1119;90-120;64.61;74.99;53.95;0.0;3116;2012.0;keyflower

Each faction brings a different game mechanism into play &ndash; pirates move cards, zombies bring cards back from the discard pile, dinosaurs have huge power &ndash; and every combination of factions brings a different play experience.&#10;&#10;During play, Base cards (each with their own difficulties and abilities) are in play. You attempt to have the most power on the Base from your minions when the Base is smashed. Sounds easy?  How easy is it when an opponent's Alien-Ninja decides to Beam Up your minions to other Bases - flat out Assassinate them? What about when the Pirate-Dinosaur player Full Sails in and releases King Rex to stomp your minions into the ground, or when the Wizard-Zombies use their Mystic Power to create an Outbreak, suddenly flooding minions onto the Base from the discard pile? Or what if you faced a Zombie-Dinosaur player instead and he created an Outbreak of massive beasts all at once?!?&#10;&#10;When a Base is smashed, each player in first, second and third place scores points. Fourth place? Sorry, bro &ndash; try harder next time.&#10;&#10;With eight different factions, Smash Up includes dozens of combinations to try.

The winner is the player who gains the most Lire by selling valuable produce, gaining popularity in the villages, and fulfilling Produce Orders.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Game Set Up and Play&#10;&#10;During setup in Cinque Terre, colored dice are randomly pulled from a cloth bag and rolled to establish the prices each village will pay for select produce. Each player also begins play with a private order only she can fulfill. Five public orders are turned up that all players can work on, though only the first player to fulfill each public order will score points for it. The Most Popular Vendor cards (1 for each village) are placed face up along one side of the board. The first player to fill an entire row with produce cubes for a particular village earns the Most Popular Vendor card for that village, which provides bonus points. Four Produce cards are turned face up and each player receives 4 to begin with along with a Fulfillment board and Produce Truck in their color.&#10;&#10;On your turn, you can perform 3 actions in any order or combination you choose:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Take a Produce Card - either a faceup card or one from the deck.&#10;     Move your Produce Cart up four spaces clockwise around the board.&#10;     Harvest produce from the location your cart is currently at. Each produce cube you wish to harvest requires a matching card. Two identical cards can be used in place of any one other card. Your cart can hold up to 4 produce cubes at a time.&#10;     Deliver produce to a village. Unload the produce cubes you wish to deliver and place them in the appropriate spaces for that village on your fulfillment card.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of your turn, if you complete a public order or achieve Most Popular Vendor, take the appropriate card, scoring the points indicated. You can only complete one public order per turn. When you complete a public order, you must draw a new card from the Order Deck. If you would like to keep that card as a private order, add it to your hand and draw another and place it face up to replace the public order just completed. If you do not wish to keep the card you drew as a private order, place it face up instead. Any private orders not fultilled by game end count as negative points against you.&#10;&#10;Players take turns taking their 3 actions until one player has completed 5 public orders (Most Popular Vendor Cards also count as public orders for determining game end), then everyone gets one more turn, including the player who caused the game to end.&#10;&#10;";5;60;13;2;60;Cinque Terre;60;2013;Martin Hoffmann,Claus Stephan,Mirko Suzuki;Farming,Transportation;Chris Handy;Country: Italy;Action Point Allowance System,Pick-up and Deliver,Set Collection;Rio Grande Games;7.06721;958;cinque terre;26;0.0;0.0;3.602941176470588;0;0.0;fs20t12ruG;False;0;5.0;60.0;13.0;2.0;60.0;Cinque Terre;34;2-5;194;60;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;498;2013.0;cinque terre

732;7819;124361;"Two thousand years ago, the Roman Empire ruled the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. With peace at the borders, harmony inside the provinces, uniform law, and a common currency, the economy thrived and gave rise to mighty Roman dynasties as they expanded throughout the numerous cities. Guide one of these dynasties and send colonists to the remote realms of the Empire; develop your trade network; and appease the ancient gods for their favor &mdash; all to gain the chance to emerge victorious!&#10;&#10;Concordia is a peaceful strategy game of economic development in Roman times for 2-5 players aged 13 and up. Instead of looking to the luck of dice or cards, players must rely on their strategic abilities. Be sure to watch your rivals to determine which goals they are pursuing and where you can outpace them! In the game, colonists are sent out from Rome to settle down in cities that produce bricks, food, tools, wine, and cloth. Each player starts with an identical set of playing cards and acquires more cards during the game. These cards serve two purposes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    They allow a player to choose actions during the game.&#10;    They are worth victory points (VPs) at the end of the game. &#10;&#10;&#10;Concordia is a strategy game that requires advance planning and consideration of your opponent's moves. Every game is different, not only because of the sequence of new cards on sale but also due to the modular layout of cities.

Set in the cyberpunk future of Android and Infiltration, the game pits a megacorporation and its massive resources against the subversive talents of lone runners.&#10;&#10;Corporations seek to score agendas by advancing them. Doing so takes time and credits. To buy the time and earn the credits they need, they must secure their servers and data forts with &quot;ice&quot;. These security programs come in different varieties, from simple barriers, to code gates and aggressive sentries. They serve as the corporation's virtual eyes, ears, and machine guns on the sprawling information superhighways of the network.&#10;&#10;In turn, runners need to spend their time and credits acquiring a sufficient wealth of resources, purchasing the necessary hardware, and developing suitably powerful ice-breaker programs to hack past corporate security measures. Their jobs are always a little desperate, driven by tight timelines, and shrouded in mystery. When a runner jacks-in and starts a run at a corporate server, he risks having his best programs trashed or being caught by a trace program and left vulnerable to corporate countermeasures. It's not uncommon for an unprepared runner to fail to bypass a nasty sentry and suffer massive brain damage as a result. Even if a runner gets through a data fort's defenses, there's no telling what it holds. Sometimes, the runner finds something of value. Sometimes, the best he can do is work to trash whatever the corporation was developing.&#10;&#10;The first player to seven points wins the game, but not likely before he suffers some brain damage or bad publicity.&#10;&#10;";2;45;14;2;45;Android: Netrunner;45;2012;Bruno Balixa,Ralph Beisner,Del Borovic,Gong Studios,Amelie Hutt,Henning Ludvigsen,Ed Mattinian,Dallas Mehlhoff,Adam Schumpert,Mark Anthony Taduran;Bluffing,Card Game,Collectible Components,Science Fiction;Richard Garfield,Lukas Litzsinger;Android,Android: Netrunner LCG,CCGs (Collectible Card Games),Cyberpunk,Hackers,Living Card Game;Action Point Allowance System,Hand Management,Secret Unit Deployment,Variable Player Powers;Fantasy Flight Games,Arclight,Edge Entertainment,Galakta,Game Harbor,Giochi Uniti,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.;8.0044;20271;android: netrunner;10;4.0;4.5;3.706539923954373;0;-0.0;08q3IWC9lC;False;0;2.0;60.0;14.0;2.0;30.0;Android: Netrunner;263;2;2352;30-60;199.99;0.0;0.0;0.0;2323;2012.0;android: netrunner

741;7901;126444;"In The Hobbit Card Game, two teams play against each other: good versus bad. The basic game mechanism is trick-taking, but whoever wins the trick can distribute the cards amongst all the players, depending on his character's ability. Bilbo, for example, must keep one card from the trick, give one card to another player, then discard the remaining cards.&#10;&#10;In addition to a special ability, each character has a special affinity with the forces that govern his motives. Gandalf, Bilbo, and Thorin are scions of good, while Smaug and Bolg are cruel and evil. The cards respond to these alignments accordingly: a white star on the card symbolizes the forces of good; the helm of an orc adorns cards possessed of evil power; and a card with a pipe grants players the ability to draw an extra card in the next round. If a card with the opposite power is assigned to your character (Gandalf gets an orc helmet, or Smaug gets a star), then that character takes a point of damage. If your character is already damaged and is assigned a card with the symbol of their own side (Bilbo gets a star, or Bolg gets an orc helmet), then that character gets a single point of damage healed. Two points of damage eliminates a character from the game, so use the cards you win to knock out your opponents and heal your allies.&#10;&#10;The round ends when players have emptied their hands, and the last of the cards that were in play have been assigned to the characters. Players who have taken enough damage are eliminated at this point. Depending of the number of players, if enough good characters have survived, the game continues until the final round.

Once every player has taken five actions, night falls, with players gathering Prayer Points from their temples, drawing Divine Intervention cards, and determining the turn order before the start of the new day.&#10;&#10;As the game progresses, they can use Prayer Points to acquire power tiles. Some of these enroll magical creatures and have them join their troops. In addition to intimidating enemies, these creatures provide special powers!&#10;&#10;Detailed miniature components represent the combat units and the supernatural creatures that are summoned to enhance them.

745;7917;127095;"Starting from the heart of Africa, players in Origin will determine the course of mankind's expansion on our planet, with the tribes gradually growing more diversified over time while still maintaining links to their ancestors and to all inhabitants of Earth.&#10;&#10;The game tokens in Origin come in three colors, three heights, and three thicknesses, and at the start of the game one of the smallest, skinniest pieces is placed in the center of Africa. In addition, you place three technology tiles at random on the tan, orange and violet sections of the tech chart and six random tiles on the brown section; the tech tiles show 1-5 arrows. You also shuffle tan, orange and violet decks of cards and place them in the appropriate places. Tan cards provide an one-shot effect, orange cards give you a permanent power, and violet cards present you with an objective you must meet; if you do so, you can play the objective card on your turn, and immediately draw another. You can play at most one card of each color each turn.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player takes one of three actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Place a new piece on a region of the game board, with this piece sharing two of the three characteristics of a piece in a neighboring region; the new piece cannot be shorter than the original piece. Mark this piece with a token of your player color.&#10;    Move one of your pieces on the board to an empty region, with short pieces moving only one space, medium height pieces moving up to two spaces, and tall pieces up to three.&#10;    Take over a region controlled by an opponent by moving one of your pieces into this region and relocating the opponent's piece to the region your piece left. You can do this only if the attacking piece is thicker than the opponent's piece.&#10;&#10;&#10;When you place a new piece on the board or move an existing piece, you're rewarded based on the color of the space you occupy. If you place in or move into a tan, orange or violet region, either you take a tile and the top card of this color or you draw three cards of this color and keep one of them. For a brown region, you either draw two tiles from the brown section of the tech board or draw one tile from anywhere. The technology tiles must be acquired from low to high &ndash; so you can't acquire a 4 unless you have a 3 &ndash; but you can have multiple tech stacks. You must meet a certain technology threshold in order to play the orange cards and acquire their special power.&#10;&#10;In addition, you can score points during the game by occupying a grassland on a continent or the two regions on opposite sides of a waterway strait.&#10;&#10;Players take turns until either all of the pieces are on the game board or all the tiles have been acquired or all the cards of one color have been drawn. Once this happens, players tally their points for objectives, grasslands, straits, tech tiles, and cards still in hand to see who wins!&#10;&#10;";4;60;8;2;45;Origin;60;2013;Carole Carrion;Exploration,Prehistoric;Andrea Mainini;;Area Control / Area Influence,Area Movement,Hand Management,Set Collection;Matagot,Group SNE,REXhry;6.80416;716;origin;62;0.0;0.0;2.75;0;0.0;Nvx3hA09yQ;False;0;4.0;60.0;8.0;2.0;45.0;Origin;8;2-4;30;45-60;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;120;2013.0;origin

Five building cards are placed face-up in the Great Works area and can be built by the players; any time a building is taken from this area, reveal another building card.&#10;&#10;On a turn, you first move any card(s) played the previous turn to the forum, then you either Command or Plot. To Command, you play one card from your hand with the order you want to carry out or two identical cards, which allows you to take any order. The orders are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Production: Place one card from the forum into your stock. For each Production activity you have, take the action again.&#10;    Exploration: Place one card from your hand into your stock. Repeat for each Exploration activity.&#10;    Draconians: Show one card from your hand, then move one card of this type from the forum to your stock; in addition, each player who commanded in his previous turn must give you a card of the same type from his hand, if possible. For each Draconians activity you have, you can show one more card, which lets you claim more from the forum and possibly more from opponents.&#10;    Trade: Transform one resource in your stock to an activity. Repeat for each Trade activity.&#10;    Construction: Start a new building (by discarding a matching color resource from the forum) or transfer a resource from your stock to a building in progress. Repeat for each Construction activity.&#10;&#10;&#10;When you complete a building, you gain its special ability for the remainder of the game. You can have only two activities, plus one more for each completed building you own. If you have more of a particular ability than anyone else, you claim the monopoly card for this activity, making each of these activities worth 1 victory point (VP) and allowing you to claim a matching resource whenever anyone completes a building of this color.&#10;&#10;If you Plot instead of Command, you first copy one order showing in another player's area (if you have an activity of the same color), then you either draw until you have five cards or draw one card (if you already have at least five).&#10;&#10;The game continues until one or more players hits a VP threshold (14-20 depending on the number of players).

Unlike many co-operative games, the simultaneous, real-time nature of the game helps prevent groupthink. This forces players to make decisions with minimal feedback and prevents one player from simply running the show. Your turn never ends, and is only limited to what you can accomplish in 15, 30, 45 or 60 second intervals.&#10;&#10;Each player uses a timer to keep track of their time, moving the timer down a track based upon how long their turn interval is. In most scenarios, the turn interval is based upon the Life Support system status: the more damaged the system is, the less air the player has to &quot;breathe&quot;, thus each turn is extended, as it takes more time to complete their actions.&#10;&#10;The modular board pieces in Damage Report ensure a brand new experience with each game scenario. Each scenario has their own 'success' and 'failure' conditions. The Standard Edition of the game includes three scenarios, however a number of additional scenarios will available as expansions.

To start, you receive in secret one suspect card (out of 12), one crime card (out of 10), and one location card (out of 14); this set of information represents the case that the player to your left must solve. The game board shows fourteen locations arranged so that each location touches a few others; each location has space for a suspect and crime tile. Shuffle the suspect tiles (12, plus two &quot;no suspect&quot;) and the crime tiles (10, plus four &quot;no crime&quot;), then place one face up in each location. Each suspect, crime and location is included in a deck of evidence cards, and nine evidence cards are revealed.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either places an investigator, chooses an evidence card, or attempts to solve her case. When you place an investigator in a location, the player to your right looks at his case cards, then places a disc on this space for each case card he holds that matches the suspect, crime or location in this space. Additionally, he places a cube on this space for each suspect, crime or location that's adjacent to this space.&#10;&#10;When you choose an evidence card, the player to your right places a disc on the matching tile if the card matches one of the case cards he holds, places a cube on the matching tile if this tile is adjacent to a tile matching one of the case cards he holds, or places nothing if you've made a wild-eyed guess and the tile isn't adjacent to anything.&#10;&#10;To attempt to solve the case, you place a black token on your guesses. If wrong, you're penalized two points and continue play next turn.

Players take turns doing the following: On a turn, a player rolls all of her dice not already on cards, then places any dice that match the targets on the corresponding cards. (Alternatively, before taking her turn, a player can first choose to reclaim all of her dice from all cards.)&#10;&#10;If the player now fulfills the target with her dice &ndash; e.g., a pair of 3s, a quartet of 6s, or a specific combination of numbers &ndash; she claims the card, takes back her dice (and returns any other dice on the card to their owner), then places a new card on the table. Each card is worth a certain number of points.

758;8019;129437;"Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game is set in the Marvel Comics universe. To set up the game, players choose a mastermind villain (Magneto, Loki, Dr. Doom, etc.), stack that particular villain's attack cards underneath it, then modify the villain deck as needed based on that villain's particular scheme. Players then choose a number of hero decks &ndash; Spider-Man, Hulk, Cyclops, Wolverine, etc. &ndash; and shuffle them together; since players use only a handful of hero decks out of the fifteen included, the hero deck can vary widely in terms of what's available.&#10;&#10;Over the course of the game, players will recruit powerful hero cards to add to their deck in order to build a stronger and more resourceful deck. Players need to build both their recruitment powers (to enlist more heroes) and their fighting ability (to combat the villains who keep popping up to cause trouble). Players recruit heroes from an array of five cards, with empty slots refilled as needed. At the start of a player's turn, he reveals a villain and adds it to the row of villains. This row has a limited number of spaces, and if it fills up, the earliest villain to arrive escapes, possibly punishing the heroes in some way. Some villains also take an action when showing up for the first time, such as kidnapping an innocent bystander. The villain deck also contains &quot;master strike&quot; cards, and whenever one of these shows up, the mastermind villain (controlled by the game) takes a bonus action.&#10;&#10;As players fight and defeat villains, they collect those cards, which will be worth points at game's end. Players can also fight the mastermind; if a player has enough fighting power, he claims one of the attack cards beneath the mastermind, which has a particular effect on the game. If all of these cards are claimed, the game ends and players tally their points to see who wins. If the mastermind completes his scheme, however &ndash; having a certain number of villains escape, for example, or imposing a certain number of wounds on the heroes &ndash; then the players all lose.&#10;&#10;";5;45;14;1;45;Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game;45;2012;Julius Abrea,Will Conrad,Bien Flores,Katrina Mae Hao,Ray Anthony Height,Tony Kordos,Jay David Ramos,Nigel Raynor,Kevin Sharpe,The Marvel Bullpen,Brian “Tots” Valerz;Card Game,Comic Book / Strip;Devin Low;Comics: Marvel Universe,Legendary,Solitaire Games,Superheroes;Co-operative Play,Deck / Pool Building;Upper Deck Entertainment;7.63589;12468;legendary: a marvel deck building game;40;2.5;3.0;3.5566642345956163;0;0.27;5uqIWPjZZM;False;0;5.0;45.0;14.0;1.0;45.0;Legendary: A Marvel Deck Building Game;251;1-5;3811;45;43.99;101.95;57.95;0.0;1888;2012.0;legendary: a marvel deck building game

762;8036;129904;"The Knights of the Round Table must assemble once again to protect King Arthur's kingdom from numerous threats. But wait &ndash; these aren't the knights of old, but rather their children. Can these newcomer knights prove up to the task of tracking the dangers out there and putting a stop to them before it's too late?&#10;&#10;In Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game, the players (mostly) work together to complete quests before the danger level of a quest gets too high.&#10;&#10;In game terms, the quests are represented by five types of cards, with each card showing 1-3 swords, as well as a number from 2 to 5 or a question mark. These cards are shuffled together with Morgan le Fay cards (which curse the players when they appear) and Merlin cards (which remove some aspects of the curse) to form the rumor deck. Each player receives a secret loyalty card at the start of the game, with at most one person being a traitor to the cause. On a turn a player either:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Reveals a rumor card.&#10;    Attempts a quest.&#10;    Accuses a knight.&#10;&#10;&#10;To reveal a rumor card, the player flips it onto the top of the revealed stack of cards. If it's a quest card, players try to keep track of the total value of cards from that quest, with ?s each worth as many points as the number of ?s revealed of that quest. If a Morgan le Fay is revealed, players can no longer speak to one another; in addition, Morgan twists the values of some cards or removes some from play. Merlin allows players to speak once again.&#10;&#10;Players are trying to stop quests when the total value is 11, 12 or 13. Any lower, and they arrived too soon, wasting time; any higher, and they arrived too late. To attempt a quest, the player points to the top quest card and says, &quot;It's time.&quot; The player then reveals all cards in the deck. If the sum of that quest is 11-13, then the players receive 1-3 white swords, as shown on the quest cards. If lower, they receive one black sword; if higher, 1-3 black swords. All other quests are checked to see whether the players were too late, then the stack resets. A failed quest rewards the attempter with a special bonus card for later use.&#10;&#10;Once three swords have been claimed, whatever the color, a player can choose to accuse another player of being traitorous to the cause, winning a reward if correct and a penalty otherwise. If the players collect seven white swords, they have stopped Morgan's forces and win. If, however, they collect seven black swords first, then Arthur's kingdom falls.&#10;&#10;Reimplements&#10;&#10;    Shadows over Camelot&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;";7;20;0;1;20;Shadows over Camelot: The Card Game;20;2012;Cyrille Daujean,Julien Delval;Bluffing,Card Game,Deduction,Fantasy,Medieval,Memory,Mythology;Bruno Cathala,Serge Laget;The Legend of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table,Shadows over Camelot;Co-operative Play,Memory,Partnerships;Days of Wonder;5.79006;902;shadows over camelot: the card game;54;0.0;0.0;2.7525;0;0.16;bs8B6TBLiM;False;0;7.0;30.0;0.0;1.0;20.0;Shadows Over Camelot: The Card Game;20;1-7;50;20-30;20.99;0.0;0.0;0.0;247;2012.0;shadows over camelot: the card game

Well, that's neither here nor there for now &ndash; let's get out there and free her from the enchanted tower.&#10;&#10;In Der verzauberte Turm, one player plays the sorcerer and at the start of the game he hides a key under one of 16 spaces on the game board. The other players collectively take the part of Robin, who tries to find the key before the sorcerer can reach it. No matter who finds the key first, though, that player gets to try the key in one of the six locks on the tower; if he chooses the right one, the princess jumps free of the tower and that player wins. If not, the sorcerer hides the key once again, and everyone moves back to their starting locations.&#10;&#10;The sorcerer starts the game on a supplementary movement board that takes him eight spaces to cover, giving Robin time to search various locations first for the key. (Robin and the sorceror are apparently magnetized, and when the character passes over the key location, the key will &quot;clack&quot; to its underside.) How do the pieces move? Each turn the sorcerer rolls a symbol die that shows which character moves first that turn; the Robin players take turns rolling a number die, which has values for both Robin and the sorcerer.

The players recruit and mobilize their units in order to gain control of the various areas on the board. Battle is resolved using dice as in regular Risk, but also with special power cards which are given to players who control certain areas on the board.

767;8102;131287;"After one hundred years in service, the Panama Canal still is one of the most important and impressive engineering achievements in modern times.&#10;&#10;Built in 1914, it held a prominent role in the deployment of military vessels during WWI and in the conflicts that have followed. Nowadays commercial usage is the core business of the Canal; its economic impact is profound and has not only developed the region, but in fact helped define shipping throughout the world.&#10;&#10;In the wake of the Canal&rsquo;s opening hull designs were influenced accordingly; ships fell into three categories, those that could travel through easily and in groups (Feeder class), massive ocean-going ships too big to enter the Canal (ULCV or Ultra Large Container Vessels), and the new standard&mdash;designed to the maximum limits of the Panama Canal. These ships are called PANAMAX.&#10;&#10;In Panamax each player manages a shipping company established in the Col&oacute;n Free Trade Zone. Companies accept contracts from both US coasts, China and Europe and deliver cargo in order to make money, attract investment and pay dividends. At the same time the players accumulate their own stock investments and try to make as much money as possible in an effort to have the largest personal fortune and win the game.&#10;&#10;Panamax features several original mechanisms that blend together; an original dice (action) selection table, pickup-and-deliver along a single bi-directional route, a chain reaction movement system&mdash;&ldquo;pushing&rdquo;  ships to make room throughout the Canal and a level of player interaction that is part self-interest, part mutual advantage and the freedom to choose how you play.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players remove a die from the Action table to select Contracts and Load Cargo or Move ships until the pool of dice is emptied ending the Round. Over the course of three rounds these actions are blended during the turn to create a logistics network which the players use to ship their cargo, minimize transportation fees and increase the net worth of their Companies. Each Company has a limited amount of Stock that the players can purchase in exchange for investing&mdash;receiving a dividend each round. The questions for the players will be which companies are likely to yield higher dividends?&#10;&#10;There&rsquo;s more to explore and several ways to win, but we ask that you join us at the table and celebrate the 100th Anniversary of the Panama Canal with a session of Panamax!&#10;&#10;";4;100;12;2;100;Panamax;100;2014;Filipe Alves,Gil d'Orey;Economic,Nautical,Transportation;Gil d'Orey,Nuno Bizarro Sentieiro,Paulo Soledade;Cities: Panama City,Country: Panama;Area Control / Area Influence,Dice Rolling,Pick-up and Deliver,Point to Point Movement,Stock Holding,Worker Placement;MESAboardgames,Arclight,HC Distribuzione,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Stronghold Games;7.41513;2513;panamax;94;0.0;0.0;3.624285714285714;0;-0.53;AZwKU3aCNa;False;0;4.0;120.0;12.0;2.0;90.0;Panamax;70;2-4;137;90-120;91.98;0.0;0.0;0.0;1043;2014.0;panamax

In this case, if you can't (or don't) reveal the appropriate character, you lose an influence, turning one of your characters face-up. Face-up characters cannot be used, and if both of your characters are face-up, you're out of the game.&#10;&#10;If you do have the character in question and choose to reveal it, the opponent loses an influence, then you shuffle that character into the deck and draw a new one, perhaps getting the same character again and perhaps not.&#10;&#10;The last player to still have influence &ndash; that is, a face-down character &ndash; wins the game!&#10;&#10;A new &amp; optional character called the Inquisitor has been added (currently, the only English edition with the Inquisitor included is the Kickstarter Version from Indie Boards &amp; Cards.

769;8124;131904;"They were tough times, the days when swords and magic still ruled the world. A long, destructive war had ended, and the entire continent had been unified. Before the empire's subjects had even come to know peace, however, their great emperor fell victim to disease, having never declared a successor...&#10;&#10;We must not return to that war-torn world! Thankfully you are an influential figure in the empire. Quickly lay claim to the throne and ensure the rock-solid unity and peace of the continent. Though the emperor had no son, there are seven candidates for succession, starting with the two lineal princesses. Now, let's get your favorite princess on the emperor's throne! Garner support from all over the country, clash with rival candidates and depend on your special skill!&#10;&#10;Heart of Crown is a deck-building card game. Each player starts with the same deck, strengthens that deck with strategic cards, and finally one player will declare victory by throning the princess he controls. Each player's deck starts with seven &quot;Rural&quot; territory cards and three &quot;Apprentice Handmaid&quot; succession cards (an unreliable subject). Using the currency (coins) generated by your &quot;Rural&quot; territory cards, you incorporate cards from the market into your deck according to your own strategy.&#10;&#10;Each player's main goal is to give the princess he's fielded the throne. First, collect stronger territory cards such as &quot;City&quot; and &quot;Metropolis&quot; to increase your coins, and declare fielding a princess using these coins. There are five princesses and one set of twin princesses, totaling six princess cards. Each princess has special support abilities, but with only one of each, you need to be quick to field the right princess and get the support you need!&#10;&#10;For your princess to take the throne, you must collect Succession Points, which represent the support of your loyal subjects and influential figures in the empire. Once you control 20 Succession Points, you may declare a coronation. Your opponents get one more turn to interrupt your coronation, but if your points remain at or above 20 by your next turn, the coronation succeeds and your princess takes the throne!&#10;&#10;";4;30;12;2;30;Heart of Crown;30;2011;Haniwa,Yuji Himukai,medilore,Chosuke O-ide,Yuki Takahata,Nemigi Toto;Card Game,Fantasy;ginkgo;Anime & Manga,Heart of Crown;Card Drafting,Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management,Variable Player Powers;FLIPFLOPs,Japanime Games,Japon Brand;7.68491;106;heart of crown;80;0.0;0.0;3.733333333333333;0;0.02;QLVQK2xw9Q;False;0;4.0;75.0;13.0;2.0;60.0;Heart of Crown;15;2-4;49;60-75;48.95;0.0;47.95;0.0;332;2011.0;heart of crown
770;8127;132018;"Description from the designer:&#10;&#10;The players in the game take on the roles of Churchill, Roosevelt, or Stalin as they maneuver against each over the course of 10 Conferences that determine who will lead the Allied forces, where those forces will be deployed, and how the Axis will be defeated. The player whose forces collectively have greater control over the surrendered Axis powers will win the peace and the game.&#10;&#10;Churchill is NOT a wargame, but a political conflict of cooperation and competition. While the game focuses on 10 of the historical conferences from 1943 till the end of the war these and much of this design should not be taken literally. Before and after each conference small groups of advisors and senior officials moved between the Allied capitals making the deals that drove the post war peace. Each conference sees one of a group of issues nominated for inclusion in the conference. The issues categories are: Theater leadership changes, directed offensives, production priorities, clandestine operation s, political activity, and strategic warfare (A-bomb). Each of the historical conference cards independently puts some number of issues such as directed offensives or production priorities metaphorically put on the table, while the players nominate an additional 7 issues.&#10;&#10;The game display for this is a circular conference table that the three players sit around behind their 'seat'. Each player has a staff deck of named personages, such as Secretary Stimson and Anthony Eden that are randomly drawn to make your conference hand. A pre-conference round of cards gives leverage to the winner who then moves an issue toward their side of the table equal to the value of the card played. Play then proceeds with the conference where each player in turn plays a card on one of the issues in the center of the conference table moving it the value of the card toward his side of the table. Each card is an historical personage and they often have bonuses if played on a particular category of issue. Contesting an issue has you move an issue away from an Ally toward your own. At all times each player has his Head of State card (Roosevelt, Churchill, or Stalin) that can weigh in on any issue once per conference by discarding another card. Each use of your personage has a bonus and a potential penalty. Each time Roosevelt is used he may die and be replaced by Harry Truman. Churchill can have a heart attack and miss the next conference, while Stalin's paranoia may cause a mini-purge and reduce his side's effectiveness for the remainder of the conference. The net result of the conference play is players will 'win' various issues with the player who won the most issues gaining leverage in one of the bilateral global issues (UK versus USSR global issue is Free Europe versus Spheres of Influence).&#10;&#10;The game then moves into a post-conference phase where players implement the issues that they now control. These actions impact three basic game functions: clandestine operations, political activity, and military offensives. Clandestine operations has players try to establish political networks in conquered countries and colonies. Using a very simple mechanic of placing a network or removing an opponent's network, the historical ferment that occurred in Yugoslavia, France and across the world is simply simulated. A country or colony can only have one dominant side's network at any given time, and during political activity players can emplace friendly governments in exile that can be subsequently undermined and replaced if the supporting networks are later neutralized by one of your allies.&#10;&#10;Once this has all been sorted out, the military portion of the game keeps the score. There is a separate display that abstractly represents the major theaters of war, Western, Eastern, Mediterranean, Arctic (Murmansk convoys and Scandinavia), CBI, SW Pacific, Central Pacific, and Far East. Each of these tracks has a Allied front for which I am looking for some kind of 3D tank piece that advances toward Germany, Italy, and Japan. Using a very simple combat mechanic, each front tries to advance with Axis reserves deploying to oppose the various fronts. A successful offensive advances the front one space, although with overwhelming superiority a two-space breakthrough is possible. Naval operations are simply handled by requiring a defined level of support to advance into an amphibious entry space such as France (D-Day). When a front enters Germany, Italy or Japan they surrender, shutting down military operations, although clandestine and political activity continues until the end of the game. In the background is the development of the A-bomb and Soviet efforts to steal its secrets. If the A-bomb is available Japan can be forced to surrender sans a direct invasion.&#10;&#10;As I stated this is not a wargame, but a three-player excursion into power politics. The game takes around 3 hours to finish, but I will be including a short and medium scenario. All scenarios end with Potsdam, but you will be able to start later in the war if you only have 1 or 2 hours to play. In addition the game can be played with 3 or 2 players plus solitaire. I am very excited about the new Churchill and large scale playtesting will commence by the end of the month. More to follow...&#10;&#10;";3;300;0;1;60;Churchill;300;2015;Charles Kibler,Rodger B.

776;8167;133848;"UPDATE July 1, 2014: 16 of the original recruit cards have been updated and revised for the second printing of Euphoria. Those recruit cards are included for free in every copy of our Treasure Chest and will be available for purchase through the BGG store.&#10;&#10;You find yourself in a dystopian cityscape with a few workers at your disposal to make your mark on the world. Like most people in dystopian fiction, your workers are oblivious to their situation. This world is all they've ever known, and you may use them at your whim.&#10;&#10;The world as we know it has ended, and in its place the city of Euphoria has risen. Believing that a new world order is needed to prevent another apocalypse, the Euphorian elite erect high walls around their golden city and promote intellectual equality above all else. Gone are personal freedoms; gone is knowledge of the past. All that matters is the future.&#10;&#10;The Euphorians aren&rsquo;t alone. Outside the city are those who experienced the apocalypse firsthand&mdash;they have the memories and scars to prove it. These Wastelanders have cobbled together a society of historians and farmers among the forgotten scrap yards of the past.&#10;&#10;There is more to the world than the surface of the earth. Deep underground lies the hidden city of Subterra, occupied by miners, mechanics, and revolutionaries. By keeping their workers in the dark, they&rsquo;ve patched together a network of pipes and sewers, of steam and gears, of hidden passages and secret stairways.&#10;&#10;In Euphoria: Build a Better Dystopia, you lead a team of workers (dice) and recruits (cards) to claim ownership of the dystopian world. You will generate commodities, dig tunnels to infiltrate opposing areas, construct markets, collect artifacts, strengthen allegiances, and fulfill secret agendas.&#10;&#10;Euphoria is a worker-placement game in which dice are your workers. The number on each die represents a worker's knowledge&mdash;that is, his level of awareness that he's in a dystopia. Worker knowledge enables various bonuses and impacts player interaction. If the collective knowledge of all of your available workers gets too high, one of them might desert you. You also have two elite recruit cards at your disposal; one has pledged allegiance to you, but the other needs some convincing. You can reveal and use the reticent recruit by reaching certain milestones in the game... or by letting other players unwittingly reach those milestones for you.&#10;&#10;Your path to victory is paved with the sweat of your workers, the strength of your allegiances, and the tunnels you dig to infiltrate other areas of the world, but the destination is a land grab in the form of area control. You accomplish this by constructing markets that impose harsh restrictions of personal freedoms upon other players, changing the face of the game and opening new paths to victory. You can also focus on gathering artifacts from the old world, objects of leisure that are extremely rare in this utilitarian society. The dystopian elite covet these artifacts&mdash;especially matching pairs&mdash;and are willing to give you tracts of land in exchange for them.&#10;&#10;Four distinct societies, each of them waiting for you to rewrite history.

Imperial Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire were the two other main Central Powers.&#10;&#10;The major Allies, sometimes referred to as the Entente, consisted of the British Empire, France, Italy, the United States, and Imperial Russia.

Each turn, players simultaneously choose and reveal a card from their hand, then add the cards to the rows, with cards being placed in ascending order based on their number; each card is placed in the row that ends with the highest number that's below the card's number. When the sixth card is placed in a row, the owner of that card claims the other five cards and the sixth card becomes the first card in a new row.&#10;&#10;In addition to a number from 1 to 104, each card has a zombie point value. In Survival mode (for 3-10 players), players want to collect as few points as possible, while in Hero mode (for 2-6 players) you want to collect more zombie points than anyone else.

Your goal is to be the first player to hold 13 coins, and while you start nearly halfway to that goal, you can go down just as surely as you can go up!&#10;&#10;On a turn you take one of three actions:&#10;&#10;1) Announce your character: Claim the power of a certain character and take the associated action. You don't have to have that character card in front of you to take this action, but if someone else says that they're that character and reveals the card to prove it, that player takes the action instead while you lose one coin to the tribunal.&#10;&#10;2) Swap cards or not: Take another player's character card along with yours, place them under the table, shuffle them around a bit, then give one card back to the other player while keeping one for yourself. You (presumably) know whether you changed characters and can have some idea of who you are now, but that other player might be in the dark.&#10;&#10;3) Secretly look at your character: Look at your character card to make sure of who you are.&#10;&#10;Play continues until one player obtains 13 coins and wins!&#10;&#10;Mascarade includes more character cards than the number of players, so not all characters will be used in each game.

801;8319;139137;"Firefly: Out to the Black   is a quick card game that plays from three to five players.  It&rsquo;s unusual in that the players do not compete against each other, but compete against the game. This is a fairly new style of game called a co-op game or cooperative game. Players take on roles of the crew of Serenity and play through a series of Events. Using their Fightin&rsquo;, Flyin&rsquo;, and Thinkin&rsquo; skills they attempt to successfully complete these Events to earn Credits and Honor. If the players run out of Credits or Honor before the end of the game, they all lose and the game wins! If the players manage to complete the predetermined amount of Events without running out of Credits or Honor, they win the game, and live to fly another day!&#10;&#10;Components:&#10;&#10;Double sized Character Cards &ndash; Contains the Character&rsquo;s Skill numbers and special abilities&#10;&#10;Event Cards &ndash; These are the Events the players must overcome to win the game.&#10;&#10;Serenity Cards &ndash; These are dual use cards. The main use is to help the players overcome Events. It&rsquo;s secondary use is to determine random numbers.&#10;&#10;Alliance Cards &ndash; These are penalty cards that are drawn if the players do not do well at certain Events. Draw too many of these and the players lose the game even if they still have Credits and Honor.&#10;&#10;Gorramit Cards &ndash; These cards modify the Events, generally making them harder.&#10;A Set of Rules &ndash; The rules to the game.&#10;Honor Tokens &ndash; These are used to track the player&rsquo;s Honor.&#10;Credit Tokens &ndash; These are used to track the player&rsquo;s Credits.&#10;&#10;The Character Cards each represent one of the main Characters in Firefly. In addition to having their skills values listed, Each Character has special abilities, which cost a variable amount of Credits or Honor. On a players turn he can choose to spend Credits or Honor on one of these abilities, but it brings them closer to losing, so they need to think about whether they really need to or not.&#10;&#10;A typical turn of the game consists of the active player turning over the top Event card. Each Event card has three challenges, one Fightin&rsquo;, one Flyin&rsquo;, and one Thinkin&rsquo;. Each of these has a number, which the players must equal or exceed  to be successful in the challenge. Characters gain skill two different ways, they may play Serenity cards to gain skill, and, after playing their Serenity cards, they add a random number to determine their final skill. This is added to the Character&rsquo;s base skill number listed on their Character cards. Depending on how many challenges they successfully complete they either gain or lose Credits and/or Honor. The more successful the more they gain.&#10;&#10;Once the event is resolved, the next player starts a new turn, and turns over the next Event card. The game is over once all the Event cards have been drawn and resolved.&#10;    &#10;The Firefly TV show is about surviving with honor. Mal and his crew are continually trying to scrounge up enough credits to keep flying, while maintaining their own personal sense of honor. The game reflects this grand theme with the victory conditions, survive the Event deck without running out of Honor or Credits.  Each Event in the deck is tied to an episode in the show, and is easily recognizable by fans of the show. The Skills needed for each Event are tied to action of the episode featured on the card. A sub theme of the show is escaping notice of the Alliance, and again, with the inclusion of the Alliance deck, Firefly: Out to the Black delivers. The Alliance deck is an ever-present threat looming over the players as they desperately seek to finish the Events in the game.&#10;&#10;";5;45;14;3;45;Firefly: Out to the Black;45;2013;Zac Pensol;Card Game,Movies / TV / Radio theme,Science Fiction;Ed Bryan;TV Series: Firefly;Co-operative Play;Toy Vault, Inc.;5.75744;254;firefly: out to the black;54;0.0;0.0;3.0;0;0.0;hZOiq2IvlV;False;0;5.0;45.0;14.0;3.0;45.0;Firefly: Out to the Black;4;3-5;3;45;35.99;28.99;0.0;0.0;85;2013.0;firefly: out to the black

These actions can include Invoking a god, Moving, Attacking, playing a Divine Power card, using a god's Special Ability or Acquiring a dropped bonus chip. Red chips are stacked under each character to represent that characters health. Modifiers such as Attack Bonus, Armor, or Disabled are also represented by different colored chips. No two gods are alike, and their actions and abilities closely correlate to the mythology they were derived from. The luck of the cards you draw forces you to change your strategy from game to game.

811;8374;140717;"Progress: Evolution of Technology is a card game about researching technologies. Each player takes his civilization from early antiquity and learns various technologies, moving progressively to the Middle Ages, the Industrial Revolution, and Modern Times and ending with today's Internet or Social Welfare.&#10;&#10;Unlike other civilization games, Progress focuses on a single aspect of civilization building: researching technologies that help a society advance. The 210 technology cards in the game are divided into three ages (Ancient, Middle Ages, Industrial) and three types (Military, Science and Culture). With every advancement on a path, you gain easier access to its more advanced technologies and you'll end up opening the door to the next age.&#10;&#10;Each tech card provides one bonus, which can vary from one extra knowledge to a larger hand size. Even though most tech cards in the game come in multiple copies (usually one per player), the key technologies occur less frequently, forcing players to specialize and granting them unique advantages. Every technology you research decreases the cost of up to three more advanced technologies, accelerating the race towards the end of the game.&#10;&#10;The game play is streamlined, with players usually taking two actions, thus making each turn short and ensuring that you use the time when the others are playing for planning rather than seeing it as downtime.&#10;&#10;";5;90;12;1;90;Progress: Evolution of Technology;90;2014;David J.

If during the reign of a good king, the starting player receives a Blessing card.&#10;&#10;2.  Sin Increases Phase: Location cards are drawn and sin increases at each revealed location. This can possibly cause idols to appear or sin to spread further if sin increases at a location with an idol.&#10;&#10;3.  Prophets Work Phase: In this phase each prophet gets to use four actions to accomplish their goals. They may use their actions to move, remove sin or idols, draw resource cards, build an altar, make a sacrifice at an altar, or to give resources to another player. A prophets may also play Blessing cards at this time if they have them. In expert mode, after all the prophets take their turn, the false prophet takes his turn.&#10;&#10;4.

Unlike your parents, however, you have hopes and dreams. You want a bigger and more pleasant kingdom, with more rivers and a wider variety of trees. You want a Dominion. In all directions lie fiefs, freeholds, and feodums. All are small bits of land, controlled by petty lords and verging on anarchy. You will bring civilization to these people, uniting them under your banner. But wait. There must be something in the air; several other monarchs have had the exact same idea. You must race to get as much of the unclaimed land as possible, fending them off along the way. To do this you will hire minions, construct buildings, spruce up your castle, and fill the coffers of your treasury. Your parents wouldn&rsquo;t be proud, but your grandparents would be delighted.&#10;&#10;Contains the core Dominion card game and the expansions Alchemy and Prosperity.

You, your fellow members of the Retro City Bomb Squad, and your trusty Bomb Squad Robot are the only barriers in the way between those dastardly villains and the innocent civilians of Retro City. Lives are at stake &mdash; and time is ticking &mdash; so let's go!&#10;&#10;Bomb Squad is a cooperative game in which 2-6 players are members of a team operating a disposal robot with the mission to disarm bombs and save hostages.

Bomb Squad features:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Real-time play: Players each take a turn in clockwise order and are free to take as long as they want on their turn. However, there is a timer counting down in real time until the bombs will detonate, so players will want to be as efficient as possible. &#10;    Hidden Card Information: Players hold their cards so that the fronts are facing the other players, which requires that players give each other Intel to figure out which cards they have in hand. &#10;    Limited Communication: While players have their cards up and visible to each other, players are allowed to communicate only via the Intel they give each other, which provides hints about the cards they have in their hands. Table talk about which cards are needed, or where the robot should go, gives implied hints about which cards to play and is prohibited.&#10;    Co-operative game play: The players all work together, winning or losing collectively as a team.&#10;&#10;&#10;";6;30;10;2;10;Bomb Squad;30;2013;Luis Francisco,Rob Lundy,George Patsouras;Print & Play,Real-time;Dan Keltner,David Short;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Games by Gamesmiths,Headband deduction games,TMG Originals;Action / Movement Programming,Co-operative Play,Grid Movement,Hand Management,Memory,Modular Board,Variable Player Powers;(Web published),Tasty Minstrel Games;6.72032;533;bomb squad;38;0.0;0.0;2.9411764705882355;0;0.0;hyZDxVnPkC;False;0;6.0;30.0;10.0;2.0;15.0;Bomb Squad;17;2-6;75;15-30;39.95;69.95;36.08;0.0;220;2013.0;bomb squad

Now you're back in our homeland, and what better way to celebrate your most recent victory than to spend an evening at the Red Dragon Inn. You and your adventuring companions will spend the night drinking, gambling, and roughhousing. The last person who is both sober enough to remain conscious and shrewd enough to hold onto his Gold Coins wins the game.&#10;&#10;Now you've taken to the high seas aboard The Crimson Drake, a sturdy sailing vessel that the heroes you know and love use when their adventures take them to sea. Join the crew in the Captain Whitehawk's cabin for a pint and try to keep your sea legs!&#10;&#10;&#10;    Captain Whitehawk: Captain Whitehawk is the stalwart master of the Crimson Drake. She's a natural leader with years of experience and a wit as sharp as her saber. She&rsquo;ll take the crew to hell and back for adventure and loot, and make damn sure they have a roaring good time while they're at it.&#10;    First Mate Remy: An elf from faraway lands, Remy is an honor-bound swashbuckler who keeps the crew in line; he&rsquo;ll be the first to step in and break up a fight. The seasoned sailors know to back down before they get on his bad side. &#10;    Bryn the Boatswain: Bryn is tough as nails and knows how to keep a ship afloat.

With her knack for seeing the future, she is an invaluable, if unlikely, navigator for the Crimson Drake. After predicting countless storms and monster attacks she has earned the trust of Captain Whitehawk and her crew.&#10;&#10;&#10;The Red Dragon Inn 4 includes a Sea Event Deck that provides a new way to play RDI. Instead of the relative safety of the inn, players are now partying in the Captain's cabin aboard the Crimson Drake &ndash; and because you're out on an adventure, the party runs the risk of being interrupted by random encounters. In game terms, at the start of the game you shuffle the Sea Event Deck and place it in the middle of the table with two Progress Counters on it. You then play RDI like normal, but at the end of each player's turn, that player removes a Progress Counter from the Sea Event Deck. When you remove the last Progress Counter, reveal the top card and an Event takes place. The Sea Event Deck adds a new level of complexity to the base game. Not only will you need to protect yourself from the other players, as well as the Drink Deck, but you may find yourself forced to defend against a Sea Event. You could even end up working alongside other players to get a bonus from the various Events you'll see throughout a game.&#10;&#10;";4;60;13;2;60;The Red Dragon Inn 4;60;2013;Rose Besch,Kennon James,Beth Trott;Card Game,Fantasy,Humor,Medieval,Party Game;Cliff Bohm,Jeff Morrow,Sam Waller;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,The Red Dragon Inn;Betting/Wagering,Hand Management,Variable Player Powers;SlugFest Games;7.3788399999999985;413;the red dragon inn 4;60;0.0;0.0;3.2857142857142856;0;0.32;Z8vkCxb4bv;False;0;4.0;75.0;13.0;2.0;60.0;The Red Dragon Inn 4;7;2-4;3;60-75;25.99;48.44;32.95;30.21;179;2013.0;the red dragon inn 4
828;8441;142432;"In Continental Express, players add train cars to their station in the hope of fulfilling objectives and maximizing the value of their secret contract. To start the game, each player chooses one of two contract cards dealt to them; these contracts require players to collect icons of a particular color or groups of like-colored icons or icons and company tokens of differing colors.&#10;&#10;Players then take turns drafting cards from three face-up rows; the card on the end of each row costs nothing, the card in the middle costs $1, and the card closest to each of the three decks costs $2. Players start with no money, however, and the only way to get some is to draft it &ndash; but naturally that means you'll be forgoing other cards. If a player has train cars matching one of the three face-up objective cards, he can choose to discard those train cars and claim the objective &ndash; and since the objectives have the icons that satisfy contracts, you'll probably want to do that.&#10;&#10;In addition to train cars and money, players can draft characters, taking the special action of a character when he drafts one. Actions include things like taking a train car of your choice from the card array, stealing all money from one player, and taking a company token of the color of your choice. The card decks also include two events, and those cards flush either the objective cards on display or the smaller cards that players draft.&#10;&#10;When a player claims his fourth objective, each other player takes one more turn, then the game ends.

As one of the crew members, you and your teammates need to move and arrange these passengers as quickly as you can. Each section of the Titanic holds a pile of cards of which only the first is available.&#10;&#10;On his turn, a player draws a few cards from the main deck and tries to move passengers out of the sinking ship onto the lifeboats. Failing to move at least one passenger or needing to reshuffle the main deck might cause one section of the ship to sink, thus reducing the number of piles available as well as the hopes of those still on board. Players can also use action cards to step in at fateful times when things otherwise seem lost.

Your fleet of loyal ships, powered by the might of quantum  probability itself, carries your empire to the far-flung stars. How will history remember you? As a ravenous destroyer? A clever tactician? A dauntless explorer? Command your armada, construct world-shattering technologies, and rally the remnants of humanity for a final confrontation.&#10;&#10;In Quantum, each player is a fleet commander from one of the four factions of humanity, struggling to conquer a sector of space. Every die is a starship, with the value of the die determining the movement of the ship, but also its combat power - with low numbers more powerful. So a [ 6 ] is a quick but fragile Scout and a [ 1 ] is a slow but mighty Battlestation.&#10;&#10;Each type of ship also has a special power that can be used once per turn: Destroyers can warp space to swap places with other dice and Flagships can transport other ships. These powers can be used in combination for devastating effects. You're not stuck with your starting ships, however: using Quantum technology, you can spend actions to transform (re-roll) your ships. Randomness plays a role in the game, but only when you want: Quantum is very much a strategy game.&#10;&#10;You win by constructing Quantum Cubes - massive planetary energy extractors. Each time you build a new one, you can expand your fleet, earn a new permanent ability, or take a one-time special move.

You must skillfully manage your glass and brick production in order to build the right structures that help you to keep your business flowing. Cut the forest to keep the fires burning in the ovens, and spread and remove ponds, pits and groves to supply yourself with the items you need. Fifteen specialists are there at your side to carry out your orders...&#10;&#10;The game consists of four building periods.

At the beginning of each building period, each player needs to choose a hand of five specialists. If he then plays a specialist that no other player has remaining in his hand, he may use both abilities of that card; if two or more players play the same specialist, each of them may use only one of the two abilities. Exploiting the abilities of the specialists lets you collect resources, lay out new landscape tiles (e.g., ponds and pits), and build a variety of buildings.

Each time a player rolls an arrow, he takes one of these tokens; when the final token is taken, each player loses one life point for each token he holds, then the tokens are returned to the center of the table.&#10;&#10;If a player collects a trio of Gatling symbols on the dice, he fires one shot at everyone else and rids himself of Indian tokens.

(Thus, each player is always dealt 10 cards.) In addition to the deck, you play with five number-designation cards (numbered 1-5), five color-designation cards that match the card colors, and a player aide board.&#10;&#10;Game play follows the pattern of traditional trick-taking games. The lead player for a trick plays one card, and the other players must follow suit if possible, while throwing any other card if they can't. The highest card of the color led wins the trick, unless one or more trump cards were played, in which case the highest trump card wins the trick &mdash; but at the start of the round, trump is undetermined! To back up a step, at the start of the round, the first player reveals the top number-designation card; the numeral on that card helps determine trump as well as which cards earn or cost players points. If the number-designation card shows &quot;7&quot;, for example, then the color of the first 7 played determines the trump color for the round; use a color-designation card to mark the trump color on the player aide. What's more:&#10;&#10;&#10;    The second 7 determines which color is worth positive points; each card of this color is worth 1 point at the round's end.&#10;    The third 7 determines which the &quot;ebbes&quot; color &mdash; &quot;ebbes&quot; meaning &quot;something&quot; in Palatine; at round's end, the player(s) who don't have the most or fewest cards of this color each earn 3 points.&#10;    The fourth 7 determines which color is worth negative points; each card of this color is worth -1 point at the round's end.&#10;&#10;&#10;After four colors have been determined, the fifth color is automatically the &quot;nix&quot; color. Whoever has the most of these cards chooses the start player for the next round - after cards have been dealt for that round. At the start of the new round, reveal a new number-designation card. After all of the number-designation cards have been played &mdash; that is, after the fifth round &mdash; the game ends and the player with the most points wins.&#10;&#10;Two variants are included with ebbes. The first variant extends the game (and probably lengthens the &quot;determining&quot; time) by adding more cards to the deck. In the second variant, players take turns placing a color-designation card on the number-designation card of their choice, and those five particular cards determine the colors for trump, positive points, etc. as each of them is played. The game's website gives rules for a third variant in which each player discards one card at the start of the round, and the player in last place gets to look at these cards; whoever takes the final trick takes these cards prior to scoring.&#10;&#10;";5;45;10;3;45;ebbes;45;2013;Ronja Hähnlein;Card Game;Klaus Geis;;Trick-taking;Palatia Spiele;6.8209100000000005;232;ebbes;31;0.0;0.0;2.6666666666666665;0;0.0;GSNPDb8j8C;False;0;5.0;45.0;10.0;3.0;45.0;ebbes;3;3-5;1;45;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;148;2013.0;ebbes

Unfortunately the citizens have some pretty big demands: jobs, a theme park, a couple of cheese factories and maybe even a radio tower. A tough proposition since the city currently consists of a wheat field, a bakery and a single die.&#10;&#10;Armed only with your trusty die and a dream, you must grow Machi Koro into the largest city in the region. You will need to collect income from developments, build public works, and steal from your neighbors' coffers. Just make sure they aren't doing the same to you!&#10;&#10;Machi Koro is a fast-paced game for 2-4 players. Each player wants to develop the city on his own terms in order to complete all of the landmarks under construction faster than his rivals. On his turn, each player rolls one or two dice. If the sum of the dice rolled matches the number of a building that a player owns, he gets the effect of that building; in some cases opponents will also benefit from your die (just as you can benefit from theirs). Then, with money in hand a player can build a landmark or a new building, ideally adding to the wealth of his city on future turns.

839;8501;144239;"Impulse is a quick-playing 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) game set in space with the game board being composed of cards that have actions on them. Players also have cards in hand, and in addition to featuring one of ten possible actions, these cards have a color (red, yellow, blue or green) and a size (1, 2 or 3, as indicated by the number of icons on the card). Each card also has six edges, and these edges connect adjacent cards in the hex-shaped playing area.&#10;&#10;The cards in the playing area start face down, with each player controlling a card(their Home) on a corner of this area. Each player has two transport ships in the center of his Home card and a cruiser on an edge. Cruisers are used to patrol sectors of space and destroy opposing transports, while transports let you activate sectors that you enter.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player adds a card to the Impulse from his hand, then (optionally) performs an action for a tech in his playing area, then (optionally) performs all the actions in the Impulse, then draws two cards and adds them to his hand. The Impulse is a line of cards shared by all players that changes turn by turn as players add cards to it and as cards fall off once it reaches maximum size. Thus, players need to feed the Impulse with actions that benefit them more than opponents, but that's easier said than done.&#10;&#10;When you perform actions &ndash; whether from moving transports to them or using the Impulse &ndash; you can boost them by having minerals of the same color or lots of transports. Each action has a single numeral on it, e.g., &quot;Command [1] ship for one jump&quot; or &quot;Build [1] cruiser at home&quot;; when you boost an action, you increase that numeral.&#10;&#10;Players score points by destroying enemy ships (one point per ship), by controlling edge spaces on the central card (one point per edge), and by taking other actions via cards.

841;8534;144733;"In Russian Railroads, players compete in an exciting race to build the largest and most advanced railway network. In order to do so, the players appoint their workers to various important tasks.&#10;&#10;The development of simple tracks will quickly bring the players to important places, while the modernization of their railway network will improve the efficiency of their machinery. Newer locomotives cover greater distances and factories churn out improved technology. Engineers, when used effectively, can be the extra boost that an empire needs to race past the competition.&#10;&#10;There are many paths to victory: Who will ride into the future full steam ahead and who will be run off the rails? Whose empire will overcome the challenges ahead and emerge victorious?&#10;&#10;&#10;Game Summary&#10;Each player has their own board, with space for factories, and 3 rail tracks (to 3 different cities). On each track, use a track token to mark the progression of your rails (different colored marker for each type or rail). Some interesting twists:&#10;- The different track types must be built in a specific order (black, gray, brown, natural, white). Later tracks may never be advanced further on the track than the earlier tracks.&#10;- On each track, as the track head advances, you cross several thresholds that provide awards: the ability to start a new color of track, victory points, bonus tiles, etc.&#10;- Each track line can have one (two for the first rail) engine(s) associated with it; the size of the loco(s) determines how far down the track you actually score VP.&#10;&#10;The central board has (almost) all the locations for placing workers. Each location requires 1-3 workers (of one player; played all together). Players, who start the game with 5 workers (or 6 workers, in 2-3 player games), will take turns using a location. These provide a variety of abilities, for example:&#10;- advance 1 or more track heads by 1-3 spaces&#10;- acquire an engine or factory; engines are allocated to rail lines, while factories (the reverse side of the tile) are placed on your factory line.&#10;- earn 2 coins&#10;- take 2 temporary workers&#10;- jump ahead in turn order&#10;- acquire an engineer, which has a unique power and becomes a worker-placement location only for you&#10;&#10;Each round ends when all players have passed on placing/using workers. Then, score VP for each track and factory line. On each track line, only spaces as far down the track as the loco level will score. Each track type scores VP for every space from its track head back to where the next color of track starts. Track types built earlier (e.g. black) score less/space than later tracks (e.g., white). On each factory line the position of the purple industry marker(s) show how many VP are scored.&#10;&#10;After 7 rounds (or 6 rounds, in 2-3 player games), the game ends; most VP wins!&#10;&#10;";4;120;12;2;90;Russian Railroads;120;2013;Martin Hoffmann,Claus Stephan;Industry / Manufacturing,Trains;"Helmut Ohley,Leonhard ""Lonny"" Orgler";Admin: Better Description Needed!,Country: Russia;Worker Placement;Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH,999 Games,Asterion Press,Bard Centrum Gier,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Hobby World,MINDOK,Z-Man Games;7.82498;8889;russian railroads;4;0.0;0.0;3.855996634944004;0;0.0;dJz5fFkFEd;False;0;4.0;120.0;12.0;2.0;90.0;Russian Railroads;143;2-4;961;90-120;174.95;0.0;0.0;0.0;1861;2013.0;russian railroads

To set up the basic game, lay out 30 cards in a grid and give one card face down to each player. Each card has five attributes, with each attribute having two states: large/small, with/without a raised arm, orange autumn/blue winter background, with/without goggles, and with/without canned fish. Someone shouts &quot;Go!&quot;, then everyone looks at their card in hand. Players then start grabbing cards from the grid and stacking them in hand. The card grabbed must be identical to the top card in hand or differ from that top card in only one way. Thus, as you grab cards, the attributes of that top card will keep changing, forcing you to look for matches in new ways.&#10;&#10;Once a player thinks he can't grab any more cards, he yells &quot;Stop!&quot; The round ends, and all players check their card stacks. If someone made a mistake when grabbing cards, that player keeps none of the cards gathered that round. If the player who stopped the round made no mistakes, he earns an extra card. If, however, he stopped the round when he could have collected more cards, then he loses all the cards he's collected during this round.&#10;&#10;To set up for the next round, give each player a new face-down card and fill in the holes in the grid. When the deck runs out, complete that round, after which the game ends. Whoever has collected the most cards wins!&#10;&#10;Pick-a-Polar Bear includes two game variants. In the first, the player who has obtained the most cards in the preceding round cannot grab a card that's identical to his top card in the current round. For the second variant, shuffle eight &quot;bonus round&quot; cards into the deck. If when laying out the cards in the grid, the dealer reveals the back of a bonus round card when at least ten cards are on the table, everyone prepares for the bonus round. The dealer reveals this card, which shows two card elements such as upraised arm and goggles, and everyone races to yell out how many cards in the grid feature these two elements. Whoever yells out the correct answer first receives the bonus round card, which is worth 2 points; whoever yells out the wrong answer takes a -2 point penalty card. The dealer then continues filling the grid. (If the grid contains fewer than ten cards when a bonus round card comes up in the deck, discard this card and continue to fill the grid.)&#10;&#10;";5;15;8;1;10;Pick-a-Polar Bear;15;2013;Ari Wong;Action / Dexterity,Animals,Card Game,Party Game,Puzzle,Real-time;Torsten Landsvogt;Animal Rascals,Animals: Bears;Pattern Recognition;AURUM, Inc.,Jolly Thinkers,Zhiyanjia;6.48775;324;pick-a-polar bear;26;0.0;0.0;3.5;0;0.0;OKfnfCAaoY;False;0;5.0;15.0;8.0;1.0;10.0;Pick-a-Polar Bear;4;1-5;8;10-15;9.49;0.0;11.95;0.0;86;2013.0;pick-a-polar bear

847;8561;145371;"The Han Dynasty, founded in 206 BC, ruled the central plains and much of modern day China for nearly four hundred years. However, by late second century, court politics and poor governance has left it in rapid decline. The government was dominated by corrupt eunuchs and officials who levied heavy taxes on the peasants, resulting in public discontent. This culminated in the Yellow Turban Rebellion led by Zhang Jiao in 184 AD during the reign of Emperor Ling (168-189 AD).&#10;&#10;Although the Yellow Turban Rebellion was eventually put down, many surviving followers went on to become bandits and continued to create problems for the government. The Han army was unable to control the bandits and Emperor Ling granted direct administrative power over provinces and command of regional military to local lords. Many feudal lords took the opportunity to sever ties with the Han government and ruled independently. The more ambitious lords annexed neighboring territories to expand their power bases. This led to the emergence of the three power blocs of Wei, Wu and Shu, and ushered in the Three Kingdoms period.&#10;&#10;Three Kingdoms Redux is a board game that seeks to recreate the tripartite between the states of Wei, Wu and Shu. You assume the role of one of the three lords &ndash; Cao Cao leading Cao Wei, Sun Jian leading Eastern Wu or Liu Bei leading Shu Han. Players start the game from asymmetrical positions, reflecting the manpower advantages Wei enjoyed in the early part of the period. The weaker states of Wu and Shu protect themselves by forming an alliance. As a feudal lord, you manage the different aspects of running a state whilst guarding your borders against both rebellious border tribes and external enemies. Managing each aspect well earns victory points for your state. But beware, for the balance of power shifts constantly during the game.

Each property is represented by one or more billboards, with the more valuable properties having larger billboards. When you purchase a property, you place a billboard into your personal plastic tower; when you pass &quot;Go!&quot; on the game board, you earn income based on the height of your tower. Reach a value of $800 on your tower, and you win.&#10;&#10;When you land on an opponent's property, you pay rent to that player based on the height of her tower. If you don't have enough cash on hand, hand over the top billboard in your tower instead but keep the cash you do have. This mechanism means there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;While players don't trade properties, you can effectively steal them through the use of Empire cards and the &quot;swap&quot; face on one die, which allows you to swap the top billboards on two towers.&#10;&#10;To date, two editions have been released in the U.S.: The Second &quot;Silver&quot; Edition has some updated properties &amp; movers from the First &quot;Gold&quot; Edition, but gameplay is the same for both editions.&#10;&#10;";4;90;8;2;90;Monopoly Empire;90;2013;;Economic;;Monopoly;Auction/Bidding,Roll / Spin and Move,Set Collection;Hasbro;5.35824;239;monopoly empire;61;0.0;0.0;2.541666666666667;0;0.0;XGqm4NFiqV;False;0;4.0;25.0;8.0;2.0;10.0;Monopoly Empire;6;2-4;17;10-25;77.99;0.0;0.0;0.0;91;2013.0;monopoly empire

Now, you and your trusted circle of colleagues must travel around the world, working against all odds to hold back the approaching horror. Foul monsters, brutal encounters, and obscure mysteries will take you to your limit and beyond. All the while, you and your fellow investigators must unravel the otherworldy mysteries scattered around the globe in order to push back the gathering mayhem that threatens to overwhelm humanity. The end draws near! Do you have the courage to prevent global destruction?&#10;&#10;Eldritch Horror is a cooperative game of terror and adventure in which one to eight players take the roles of globetrotting investigators working to solve mysteries, gather clues, and protect the world from an Ancient One &ndash; that is, an elder being intent on destroying our world. Each Ancient One comes with its own unique decks of Mystery and Research cards, which draw you deeper into the lore surrounding each loathsome creature. Discover the true name of Azathoth or battle Cthulhu on the high seas.&#10;&#10;While the tasks on these Mystery cards (along with the locations of otherworldly gates, menacing monsters, and helpful clues) will often inform both your travel plans and the dangers you confront, you can find adventure anywhere in the world...even where you least expect it. It is during the Encounter Phase of each turn that players resolve combat or, alternatively, build their investigators' personal stories by reading an encounter narrative from one of several types of Encounter cards. You might go head to head with a monster in Istanbul or find yourself in a tough spot with the crime syndicate in a major city. Maybe you will embark on an expedition to the Pyramids or research a clue you uncover in the unnamed wilderness. You may even find your way through a gate and explore a dimension beyond time and space.&#10;&#10;Should you fail an encounter, the cost is steep. If you are fortunate, you will merely incur physical or mental trauma. However, you might also be compelled to take a Condition card, which represents a specific injury or restriction gained throughout your journey, such as a Leg Injury or Amnesia. You could find yourself getting in over your head to acquire assets and receive a Debt condition &ndash; or maybe you'll owe a favor to something far more insidious than a debt collector, and enter into a Dark Pact! Whatever your condition, you would be wise to find a resolution with haste; many conditions have a &quot;reckoning effect&quot; which, if triggered, ensure a much more sinister fate.&#10;&#10;All the while, the arrival of the Ancient One approaches. Its malign influence is manifested in Eldritch Horror as you draw Mythos Cards, which govern the appearance of otherworldly gates, fearsome monsters, and other ominous elements. Mythos cards keep your investigators under pressure, introducing new threats, even as the arrival of the Great Old One draws nearer! Since the investigators draw a new Mythos card each round, they're certain to have their hands full battling foul creatures and following up on strange rumors, even as they work to solve their three all-important mysteries.&#10;&#10;With twelve unique investigators, two hundred-fifty tokens, and over three hundred cards, Eldritch Horror presents an epic, world-spanning adventure with each and every game.&#10;&#10;";8;240;14;1;120;Eldritch Horror;240;2013;Anders Finér,David Griffith,Ed Mattinian,Patrick McEvoy,Dallas Mehlhoff,Emilio Rodriguez,Magali Villeneuve,Drew Whitmore;Adventure,Fantasy,Fighting,Horror,Novel-based;Corey Konieczka,Nikki Valens;Arkham Horror,Cthulhu Mythos,Eldritch Horror,Solitaire Games;Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Point to Point Movement,Variable Player Powers;Fantasy Flight Games,Arclight,Delta Vision Publishing,Edge Entertainment,Galakta,Galápagos Jogos,Giochi Uniti,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Hobby World,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,Wargames Club Publishing;7.94433;16196;eldritch horror;13;4.5;4.0;3.6670541044776117;0;0.1;ZwlnfX1J2z;False;0;8.0;240.0;14.0;1.0;120.0;Eldritch Horror;268;1-8;1255;120-240;53.95;80.62;61.99;55.99;2664;2013.0;eldritch horror
853;8598;146130;"Coin Age is a microgame for two players that's played with a single card and pocket change. Players take turns placing coins on a map to control spaces, outmaneuver their opponent, and score victory points.&#10;&#10;Coin Age uses an innovative &quot;coin slap&quot; mechanism to determine available actions. On a player's turn, he takes one of each of his remaining types of coins in hand (one quarter, one nickel, one penny, and one dime), shakes them up, then slaps them on the table. Based on the number of coins that match his &quot;side&quot;, he can then either place coins on the map, move previously placed coins to an adjacent space, or remove them altogether. When placing coins, players may also place their coins on top of the opponent's coins if their size/rank is smaller, so while a quarter will give you the most victory points at the end of the game, it has the highest probability of being covered by your opponent.&#10;&#10;Coin Age is a quick-playing area control game with lots of player interaction and a bit of push-your-luck gameplay.&#10;&#10;";2;15;0;2;15;Coin Age;15;2013;Adam P.

If the adventurers are successful, they will return with more ore, money and other rewards with which players can invest back into their burgeoning weaponsmithing empire.&#10;&#10;At its core, Forge War is a rewarding game of aggressive investment, which occurs through the acquisition of quests.

The first phase consists of moving pieces around a hex grid to maximize resource production. The second phase is a market phase that features an action blocking mechanic to gain access to new weapon plans and other advantages.

862;8642;147020;"Star Realms is a spaceship combat deck-building game by Magic Hall of Famers Darwin Kastle (The Battle for Hill 218) and Rob Dougherty (Ascension Co-designer).&#10;&#10;Star Realms is a fast paced deck-building card game of outer space combat. It combines the fun of a deck-building game with the interactivity of Trading Card Game style combat. As you play, you make use of Trade to acquire new Ships and Bases from the cards being turned face up in the Trade Row from the Trade Deck. You use the Ships and Bases you acquire to either generate more Trade or to generate Combat to attack your opponent and their bases. When you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s score (called Authority) to zero, you win!&#10;&#10;Multiple decks of Star Realms and/or Star Realms: Colony Wars, one for every two people, allows up to six players to play a variety of scenarios.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Factions&#10;&#10;Each of the cards in the 80 card Trade Deck is a Ship or a Base belonging to one of four factions: The Trade Federation, The Blobs, The Star Empire or The Machine Cult.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Trade Federation&#10;&#10;In the far future, the more traditional governing bodies of the human race have been replaced with corporate leadership. The earth and its surrounding colonies are ruled by a group of corporations called the Trade Federation. The Federation&rsquo;s policies are focused around trade and growth, but especially in profit and prosperity for those at the top of the corporate ladder. While they prefer to deal with other star realms using trade and diplomacy, they have a large defense branch dedicated to protecting the Federation&rsquo;s trade and other interests.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;The Blobs&#10;&#10;These mysterious creatures are the first alien life forms encountered by the human race. Most of the initial encounters consisted of human colonies being completely obliterated. On the few occasions that a Blob ship has been recovered somewhat intact, the only biological remains found inside have consisted of a gelatinous mass, thus leading to the moniker, &ldquo;The Blobs&rdquo;. While for several years all encounters between humanity and the Blobs have been extremely violent, there is currently some limited trade between various Blob factions and some of the more daring human traders.The Blobs are best at generating massive amounts of Combat and at removing undesirable cards from the Trade Row.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Star Empire&#10;&#10;The Star Empire consists primarily of former colonies of the Trade Federation. These colonies were on the outer edges of the Federation. Not only did they feel used by the corporations, but they felt the Federation failed to give them adequate protection from the Blobs. As a result, one ambitious colonial governor was able to unite several colonies into an independent empire under his control, one with a strong military, both for warding off the Blobs and for discouraging the Federation from trying to reclaim their lost colonies. The Star Empire is a combat oriented faction that draws lots of cards and makes the opponent discard cards.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Machine Cult&#10;&#10;A cluster of industrial mining worlds were completely cut off from the Trade Federation by the Blobs. With the threat of annihilation by the Blobs always looming and no contact with the rest of human space, these worlds were forced to take drastic measures. Soon a cult of technology arose, focused on using advanced technology, robotics and computerization to create strong defenses and a powerful military that belied their relatively small population. Since their leaders believed their salvation lay in technology, technology soon became their god and their religion. The Machine Cult gains most of its power from being able to remove undesirable cards from your deck and from having a large number of Bases designed to defend your Authority from attack.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Playing Star Realms&#10;&#10;&#226;&#128;&#139;When you play Star Realms, you will be able to acquire and use Ships and Bases of any and all of the four factions. Many cards have powerful Ally abilities that reward you for using Ships and Bases of the same faction together, however.&#10;&#10;As you acquire cards using Trade, you put them into your discard pile, to be later shuffled into your personal deck. When you draw Ships, you do what they say and they get placed into your discard pile at the end of your turn. When you draw a Base, you play it face up in front of you and may use its abilities once every turn. In addition to Combat being the way you reduce your opponent&rsquo;s Authority to zero and win the game, it&rsquo;s also useful for destroying your opponent&rsquo;s Bases. Some Bases are designated as Outposts. Your opponent&rsquo;s Outposts must be destroyed before you can use Combat to attack your opponent&rsquo;s Authority directly.&#10;&#10;Star Realms is easy to learn, especially if you&rsquo;re familiar with deck-building games, but it&rsquo;s a game that takes time to master. Each time you play, the game is filled with various strategic decision points. Should I take the best card for me or the best card for my opponent? Should I focus on taking cards of a particular faction or on taking the best card available? Should I be focusing on acquiring more Trade or more Combat? Should I attack my opponent&rsquo;s Base or their Authority? These are just some of the many choices you&rsquo;ll be faced with. New players needn&rsquo;t agonize over these choices just to play, but as they become more advanced players, they will find this depth of strategy leads to great replayability.&#10;&#10;";2;20;12;2;20;Star Realms;20;2014;Vito Gesualdi;Card Game,Fighting,Science Fiction;Robert Dougherty,Darwin Kastle;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Star Realms;Card Drafting,Deck / Pool Building,Player Elimination,Take That;White Wizard Games,ADC Blackfire Entertainment,ADC Blackfire Entertainment GmbH,Broadway Toys LTD,Devir,Hobby World,IELLO;7.64123;18434;star realms;69;2.0;2.25;4.3957214428857725;0;0.31;1dWE5BIcOm;False;0;2.0;30.0;12.0;2.0;15.0;Star Realms;499;2;6753;15-30;10.29;23.95;12.95;11.99;2724;2014.0;star realms

The two royal heirs, Prince Roland and Princess Elinor, vie for the crown.

You then fight a battle across a battlefield made up of five terrain cards; to win the game, you must take control of three of these terrain cards.

The Advanced mode includes rules for air support, destructible cover, special commander powers, and class-specific powers.&#10;&#10;On their turn, players will draw cards based on how many and which type of control points they own, move aircraft, fight other aircraft, move one squad, and fire with one squad. The game's cards allow players to recruit new units, call in airstrikes, or manipulate combat odds by upgrading the specialized attack and defense dice to more powerful ones with better results.

Each deck has a different symbol on the back to aid with card sorting between rounds.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, each player lays out three cards face up in front of her to create her post piles; places a face-up stack of ten cards, seeing only the top card, next to her post piles to create her blitz pile ; and holds the remaining cards in hand face down.&#10;&#10;Playing at the same time, each player tries to empty her blitz pile. If she has a 1 on the top of any face-up stack, she plays it to the center of the table to create a Dutch pile. If she has a 2 of the same color as any 1 on top of a Dutch pile, she can place the 2 on the 1. All cards on a Dutch pile must be played in ascending order and must be the same color. A player can also play from the blitz pile onto a post pile, or from one post pile onto another, but only if the numbers are in descending order and the boys and girls alternate.&#10;&#10;If a player can't play anything, she can reveal cards from the stack in her hand, counting them out in groups of three, then laying them face up while revealing only the top card.

875;8745;149119;"Ancient Balinese legend describes a host of powerful spirits who help poor rice farmers achieve success. These farmers have long used a sophisticated irrigation system to organize rice cultivation by integrating religious devotion and social responsibility with traditional farming methods. Even modern farmers seek to placate the spirit world in their quest to produce an abundant harvest.&#10;&#10;In Spirits of the Rice Paddy, players must compete with fellow rice farmers to construct and tend rice paddies. Oxen can build walls and remove large rocks. Ducks can be employed to eat harmful pests and fertilize the fledgling crops. Weeds must be kept at bay. Most importantly, water must be conserved and released with the greatest of care. With a little luck, all that back-breaking labor will pay off in the end. The good news is that the spirits are eager to assist, granting many special abilities, blessings, and magic.

876;8747;149155;"Dead Man's Draw is a simple and strategic card game of risk and reward for 2 to 4 players. Players take turns drawing cards and combining their special abilities to plunder the most loot without busting their entire hands.&#10;&#10;The core of your turn in Dead Man&rsquo;s Draw is all in the flip: pulling the top card off the deck and using its special ability. Your turn isn&rsquo;t over until you say it is, though. You can keep pulling cards as long as you like &ndash; until you play a card of a suit already seen, at which point you lose everything. Knowing when to stop and &quot;bank&quot; your cards is the biggest decision you make in Dead Man&rsquo;s Draw, but being too timid lets braver opponents pass you up with bigger, more profitable turns.&#10;&#10;The cards&rsquo; special abilities are key to success in Dead Man&rsquo;s Draw, and they build off of each other. Each suit in DMD has an effect that the player can target when they flip a card of that suit.&#10;&#10;Anchor &ndash; Keep everything you drew before the Anchor even if you bust.&#10;&#10;Cannon &ndash; Destroy one card an opponent has previously banked.&#10;&#10;Chest &ndash; Double your haul by banking as many cards directly from the discard pile as are in the river when you bank the Chest &ndash; but only if you also bank a Key.&#10;&#10;Hook &ndash; Play one of your previously banked cards.&#10;&#10;Key &ndash; Enables the Chest special.&#10;&#10;Kraken &ndash; Oh no! You&rsquo;re forced to draw at least two more cards.&#10;&#10;Map &ndash; Draw three cards from the discard pile and play one.&#10;&#10;Mermaid &ndash; No ability, but worth more points (Mermaids are numbered 4-9 instead of 2-7).&#10;&#10;Oracle &ndash; Look at the next card before deciding if you want to play it.&#10;&#10;Sword &ndash; Steal an opponent&rsquo;s previously banked card and play it.&#10;&#10;Many of these work well together, like using a Hook to re-play a Sword from your hand to steal an opponent&rsquo;s Chest to go with your Key &ndash; racking up huge points by playing abilities well and not solely through the luck of the draw.&#10;&#10;As soon as the deck is depleted, players total up the value of the highest card they&rsquo;ve banked from each suit.

880;8781;150312;"Welcome to the Dungeon &mdash; first released as Dungeon of Mandom &mdash; is a push-your-luck dungeon delve in which 2-4 players take turns essentially daring each other to go into a dungeon with less equipment than they start off with while filling the dungeon with monsters. Players can win the game by winning 2 rounds or get eliminated from the game by losing 2 rounds. Each player has a 2-sided players card that has a white side and a red side. The first win taps the player card and the 1st loss flips the card over to the red side. A 2nd loss will have the player turn the card back into the box.&#10;&#10;The game is played in rounds. The player sets up the base character and all the equipment equipped. This represents every player as a fully equipped dungeon delver.&#10;&#10;Each round, the start player (the person who challenged the dungeon last or the last player to be in a dungeon) can choose to draw a card from the monster deck or pass their turn.&#10;&#10;If they choose to draw, they can do one of two things: (1) keep it and de-equip an equipment or (2) place it face down in the dungeon. Placing it face down in the dungeon creates the dungeon deck and fills the dungeon with monsters that the challenger will have to face later. If they choose to pass their turn, they cannot participate in the rest of the round. Once only one person is left after all the other players have passed their turn, that player then becomes the challenger and must go into the dungeon with only the equipment he has equipped.&#10;&#10;The player then flips cards off the dungeon deck and fights the monsters within. Some equipment allow you to null the enemy damage or be able to withstand it by increasing your HP. If the player survives the dungeon with at least 1 HP, they win that round. If not, they lose. The players then reshuffles all the cards to make a new monster deck and re-equips all the equipment to start a new round.&#10;&#10;The game ends when someone has won twice or one player is the last man standing.&#10;&#10;Welcome to the Dungeon includes four different sets of character cards whereas Dungeon of Mandom has only a single character.&#10;&#10;";4;30;10;2;30;Welcome to the Dungeon;30;2013;Paul Mafayon;Bluffing,Card Game,Fantasy,Fighting;Masato Uesugi;IELLO: Mini Games;Memory,Player Elimination,Press Your Luck;BoardM Factory,Devir,GoKids 玩樂小子,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Hobby World,I Was Game,IELLO,Kaissa Chess & Games,Oink Games,Portal Games,uplay.it edizioni;6.76881;5624;welcome to the dungeon;90;0.0;0.0;3.0614890885750965;0;0.33;fogKPrFHnp;False;0;4.0;45.0;10.0;2.0;30.0;Welcome to the Dungeon;190;2-4;625;30-45;9.99;19.0;11.47;11.12;902;2013.0;welcome to the dungeon
881;8783;150376;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;&quot;Crossroads&quot; is a new series from Plaid Hat Games that tests a group of survivors' ability to work together and stay alive while facing crises and challenges from both outside and inside.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game, the first game in this series, puts 2-5 players in a small, weakened colony of survivors in a world where most of humanity is either dead or diseased, flesh-craving monsters. Each player leads a faction of survivors with dozens of different characters in the game.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is a meta-cooperative psychological survival game. This means players are working together toward one common victory condition &mdash; but for each individual player to achieve victory, he must also complete his personal secret objective. This secret objective could relate to a psychological tick that's fairly harmless to most others in the colony, a dangerous obsession that could put the main objective at risk, a desire for sabotage of the main mission, or (worst of all) vengeance against the colony! Certain games could end with all players winning, some winning and some losing, or all players losing. Work toward the group's goal, but don't get walked all over by a loudmouth who's looking out only for his own interests!&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter is an experience that can be accomplished only through the medium of tabletop games. It's a story-centric game about surviving through a harsh winter in an apocalyptic world. The survivors are all dealing with their own psychological imperatives, but must still find a way to work together to fight off outside threats, resolve crises, find food and supplies, and keep the colony's morale up.&#10;&#10;Dead of Winter has players making frequent, difficult, heavily- thematic, wildly-varying decisions that often have them deciding between what is best for the colony and what is best for themselves.&#10;&#10;";5;210;14;2;45;Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game;210;2014;David Richards,Fernanda Suárez,Peter Wocken;Bluffing,Horror,Zombies;Jonathan Gilmour,Isaac Vega;Crossroads Series;Action Point Allowance System,Area Movement,Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Storytelling,Trading,Variable Player Powers,Voting;Plaid Hat Games,Arclight,Cube Factory of Ideas,Edge Entertainment,Galápagos Jogos,Game Harbor,Gemenot,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Korea Boardgames co., Ltd.,MINDOK,Raven Distribution;7.86596;22830;dead of winter: a crossroads game;0;2.6666666666666665;2.0;3.5871631583132992;0;0.24;y56td93iXw;False;0;5.0;210.0;14.0;2.0;45.0;Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game;443;2-5;1286;45-210;45.59;74.5;55.49;47.99;3462;2014.0;dead of winter: a crossroads game

886;8808;151022;"American baseball was on its last legs as a spectator sport. Football had become the predominant national pastime &mdash; that is until the year 2032, the year baseball decided to revolutionize the game and regain the throne!&#10;&#10;Starting in 2032, baseball games were shortened to six innings. Pitchers were encouraged to have bionic arm implants to improve their pitching. These cyborgs, or 'Borgs as they're affectionately known, were immediately popular and soon ruled the league. In 2041, robotic players were introduced to get more offense back into the game. These robots were similar to designated hitters in that they were used only to bat and did not field. However, recent reports indicate fielding 'Bots are on the way.&#10;&#10;Now in 2045, human players are still in the game and known as Naturals. They are the best fielders by far but are sorely challenged when it comes to hitting and pitching. Some Naturals have learned to hit by swinging before the pitcher starts his windup, which gives them a chance to hit the ball. Although it's hard for a Natural to get into the league, those who do are popular. Many Naturals have named themselves after the great players of pre-2032 baseball by taking a first and last name borrowed from different star players of the past. The fans love them, and their presence on the team ensures good revenue!&#10;&#10;The stage is now set!

During each &quot;mini-game&quot;, each player alternates playing six cards to simulate a full game's highlights. The mini-game includes defensive and offensive actions, and your single card play may include elements of defensive and/or offensive plays. Do you try to thwart your opponent's pending hits, put up strong offensive action of your own, or use your better players to do both?

Possible actions include:&#10;&#10;     Attract Tourists from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Tourists are placed at attractions, potentially increasing the Gold gained on the subsequent turn.&#10;     Attract a Hero from the Dock (Spending Flair) - Heroes start with low health, which is gained at the end of each round. Fully Rested Heroes are scored for Victory Points.&#10;     Upgrade an Attraction (Spending Gold) - Providing higher tourist capacity, better Gold payout, better abilities and more Victory Points. Upgraded attractions typically require more workers to keep them fully staffed.&#10;     Train or Hire new Workers (Spending Gold) - Upgrade your workers to provide more work, or better abilities. Training locks a worker draft pile, preventing other players from upgrading to that particular worker during the round. Training workers is a 1-for-1 exchange, keeping players' Worker Deck lean by design. &#10;     Pass - The first Player to Pass becomes the Start Player for the next round&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Any time during a player's turn, he may use abilities from fully-staffed attractions, or discard worker cards to use their unique abilities.&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase III - A Ship Arrives&#10;&#10;The dock is refilled with new Heroes and Tourists from a center pile. While refilling, it's possible to trigger a Monster Attack!&#10;&#10;     If an Attack! card is revealed, the top Monster from the Monster Pile will choose which player it's attacking; typically by Most Tourists or Most Heroes at their resort, ties broken clockwise from the start player.&#10;     If a Hero defends against a Monster Attack, he loses 1 health. Any undefended damage causes tourists to be eaten by the Monster.&#10;     Heroes may dodge into, or out of, a Monster Attack up to one time per round.&#10;     If an attraction has no Hero or Tourists, a Monster will Damage it, potentially destroying the attraction.&#10;     A player may chose (if they have one) to throw a Lazy Peon at the monster, ending the attack and permenantly removing the Worker Card from the game.&#10;     The Dock Continues to refill, potentially triggering more Monster Attacks, until it is full.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Phase IV - Clean Up&#10;&#10;&#10;     Used and unused Workers are placed in players' discard piles.&#10;     Any fully-rested Heroes are scored - Placed to the side, each worth Victory Points at the end of the game. This Hero also removes the top Monster from the remaining Monster Deck.&#10;     Remaining Heroes gain 1 Health each.&#10;     Any Locked Worker Draft Piles and Attraction Abilities are made available for the next round.&#10;     Any unused Flair is sent back to the supply.

Thugs and holdings might have a cost to be played (perhaps cash paid to the bank or the discarding of a holding) or a condition that you must meet (having two thugs, for example, or a collection of symbols on cards in your possession) in addition to an effect, which is unique to each card. (Each action has a unique effect as well.) When you play a holding with one or more symbols, you place a token on that card for each symbol on it and an additional token for each symbol of that type already in your possession.

In a delicate balance of resource management and area control, players must plan their building strategies while carefully managing their supply tracks to refine the right resources at the most opportune times. Stay a step ahead of the competition and you could lead the West into the Golden Age.&#10;&#10;The goal of Gold West is to accumulate the most victory points through clever management of your growing mining empire. There are five resources in the game: the metals Copper, Silver, and Gold are used to acquire victory points in a variety of ways, while Timber and Stone are building materials used to build camps and settlements on the board to collect more resources and influence the landscape.&#10;&#10;Each hex contains either two or three resources. Gold generally earns players the most points, with silver and copper yielding slightly less. In addition, each terrain type scores points for the player with the most influence therein at the end of the game. Copper terrains are the most valuable, with Silver, Gold, and Forest Terrains earning slightly fewer points.&#10;&#10;When gaining new metals and materials, players place them in their &quot;supply track&quot;, a mancala-style track in which you will manage your resources. You get points the further back in the track you place them, as this creates a more refined product, but it will take longer to get these resources to the front of the supply track where they can be used.

You and the other players each have a team of five scientists, and you want to capture animal species so that you can study them &mdash; and, of course, score points.&#10;&#10;The game board in La Isla consists of a set of oddly-shaped tiles that are placed in a circular arrangement around a central polygonal tile. Thirty-five animal tokens (seven each of five types) are placed at random on spaces numbered 2, 3 and 4 on the game board; these numbers equal the number of camps that surround these spaces.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player has three cards that he places face-down in the A, B and D spaces on his card display. All players reveal their A cards at the same time, then place them in one of the three slots at the top of their display; the image depicted on the top of this card shows the special power that the owner of this card has available. Once a player has filled all three slots on her display, future cards placed with the A action cover an existing card.&#10;&#10;After revealing the cards in their B slots simultaneously, the players collect the goods depicted in the lower-left corner of their individual card.&#10;&#10;Each player in turn then places one of his scientists on a camp, first paying two resources of the type matching that camp. (If all of a player's scientists are on the board, she moves one of these scientists.) If the player now has a scientist on each camp surrounding an animal space, she takes that animal tile, scoring points for it as noted on the board (4, 3 or 2 points).&#10;&#10;Finally, the card in the D slot increases the value of one animal. You (and only you!) immediately score one point per animal of the type you moved up on the scale. If you don't have an animal of that tpe you don't get any points. Each animal has a points threshold so that if you move an animal up, say, four times, each animal of this type is worth an extra point at the end of the game. The scale goes up to five so that every animal can be worth up five points at the end of the game. When the sum of these values for all five animals equals seven, nine or eleven (based on the number of players), the game ends at the conclusion of the round. Players then tally their final scores to see who wins.&#10;&#10;";4;60;10;2;30;La Isla;60;2014;Alexander Jung;Animals;Stefan Feld;Alea Medium Box;Action / Movement Programming,Area Enclosure,Hand Management,Modular Board,Set Collection,Simultaneous Action Selection;alea,Ravensburger Spieleverlag GmbH;6.9825800000000005;3315;la isla;37;0.0;0.0;3.2994117647058827;0;0.0;kgKVBI6IiN;False;0;4.0;60.0;10.0;2.0;30.0;La Isla;85;2-4;343;30-60;39.99;44.99;42.95;0.0;452;2014.0;la isla

Hive Carbon and Hive Pocket include the Mosquito and Ladybug expansions, for a total of 26 pieces.&#10;&#10;With no setting up to do, the game begins when the first piece is placed down.

907;8939;154825;"In Arkwright players run up to four factories in England during the late 18th Century. Your goal is to have the most valuable block of own shares. Thus, you must increase your share value and buy shares from the bank.&#10;&#10;To run the factories, you need workers. When hiring Workers, demand is automatically created. But of course you want to replace your expensive workers (wage 2-5) by machines (1). To have more output from your factories you may employ new Workers or improve your factory to the next technical level.&#10;&#10;You fix the price for your goods during an action round. To enhance your chances of selling goods, you improve your factories to higher levels, increase the quality and make some sales promotion. The higher these factors, the better are your chances of success - the higher the price, the lower.&#10;&#10;Each player has an own set of &quot;action tokens&quot; like &quot;build and modernize factories&quot;, &quot;employ new workers&quot;, &quot;improve quality&quot; etc. On your turn you place one of those tokens on one of the free spaces in your line of the &quot;Administration board&quot; and pay the according administration costs, ranging from 2 to 10 (odd numbers). Some actions depend on how much you paid, i.e. you may buy more machines with one single action, when you pay more (= use a higher space, which is then blocked for the rest of the round). During the game your actions become more and more effective by new tokens, i.e. allow you to buy 3 machines in a single turn instead of 2, increase quality 2 levels instead of only 1...).&#10;&#10;After each round of actions one kind of factories is active and you have to pay for all your workers and machines there, then sell the manufactured products. The value of your shares increases for sold products and best quality.&#10;&#10;Goods may also be traded to the colonies by ship - provided you have a contract with the monopoly of the East Indian Company.&#10;&#10;After four turns each of the factories has produced and the round ends. Players remove the action tokens from the administration board and reveal an event token. After 5 rounds the player with the most valuable block of shares wins. Neither being to be the one with the most shares nor being the one with the highest share value guarantees victory.&#10;&#10;Arkwright allows you to act in different ways. Run all four factories with most possible output, set the focus on only two factories and improve them more than the others can; use shipping to colony or focus on the home market. In any way you have to react to the opponents and their strategy. Enter markets with deficit in supply or give up business where the other players start to push you out.

By the end of the game, each player will have created a unique, custom neighborhood with areas that interact with each other, hoping to outscore the competition by having the best subdivision.&#10;&#10;In the game, each player starts with a subdivision player board and a hand of hex-shaped zone tiles.

Those improvements provide money and points, while slowly covering up as many parcels as possible. Players pass the remaining zone tiles in hand to their left, then someone rolls the parcel die once again. This continues until only one zone tile remains in hand, which is discarded.&#10;&#10;Players then play another round, but at the start of the second, third, and fourth rounds, players first check to see whether they've achieved bonuses, which give them extra cash or allow for extra activations of certain zone tiles.&#10;&#10;After four rounds, the game ends, and scores are tallied, with players gaining points for parks being adjacent to other tiles, sidewalks passing through as many different zones and improvements as possible, schools ranking the best in the city, and zones connecting to the highway that runs around (or through) your subdivision.&#10;&#10;";4;45;13;1;45;Subdivision;45;2014;Klemens Franz,Ollin Timm;City Building;Lucas Hedgren;;Card Drafting,Dice Rolling,Route/Network Building,Tile Placement;Bézier Games, Inc.;6.58102;827;subdivision;76;0.0;0.0;3.215625;0;0.36;n5Pv4z3bxQ;False;0;4.0;60.0;13.0;1.0;45.0;Subdivision;32;1-4;81;45-60;31.99;49.99;33.27;0.0;428;2014.0;subdivision

Every game is played over a series of rounds, as you and your opponents play character cards in an attempt to claim the Iron Throne for yourselves.&#10;&#10;In each round, you pursue your own plans and seek to foil your opponents by playing character cards. Each turn, you will play a character card from your hand, adding to the court at King&rsquo;s Landing. You can advance your own prospects by playing your character cards cleverly, but certain rules govern exactly where you can place your character cards.&#10;&#10;The first character cards must be played in a single row, forming the bottom row of the court. Once there are two cards in a row, you may play a card in a new row above them. The card that you play in the new row, however, must match the House of one of the two cards below it. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, character cards are divided between House Stark, House Lannister, House Baratheon, and House Targaryen, and each player may have character cards from any of these Houses in his hand.&#10;&#10;The court develops as you and your opponents play cards, but a player will eventually discover that he can no longer legally play a character card. Once this occurs, that player is eliminated and the round continues. A round ends when no one can play another character card, and whoever played the last character card wins the round. In Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you will play rounds equal to the number of players.&#10;&#10;If you win a round of Game of Thrones: Westeros Intrigue, you reap the rewards by drawing an Iron Throne card, which cancels a number of your penalty points. Your opponents, on the other hand, must take penalty points equal to the number of character cards that they have left in their hand. Over the course of the game, players gain penalty points from having character cards at the end of the round, and reduce their penalty points by winning a round and drawing an Iron Throne card.

Traits like Hard Shell and Horns will protect your species from Carnivores, while a Long Neck will help them get food that others cannot reach. With over 4,000 ways to evolve your species, every game becomes a different adventure.&#10;&#10;Evolution packs a surprising amount of variety for a game with simple rules.  The variety comes from the synergies between the trait cards and from the different personalities at the table.  Some players thrive on creating Carnivores to wreak havoc on their fellow players.  Others prefer to stay protected and mind their own business.  Evolution encourages both play styles by giving each of them multiple paths to victory.  And it is the mix of play styles at the table that ultimately determines the ecosystem in which the players are adapting.

Players also have access to leader cards for the territories that allow it and where they were elected leader during the assembly. Each Assembly reallocates those cards. Finally, they collect &quot;epic tales&quot; cards that depict the deeds of the ancient Irish gods and heroes, like Cuchulainn, the Dagda, Lugh and many others. These will be kept and used to inspire the clans and achieve extraordinary feats...under the right circumstances. The cards provide a variety of actions: adding clans, moving clans, building/exploring, and special actions.&#10;&#10;Careful drafting, hand management, bluffing (especially once players understand the importance of passing their turn), good timing, and a precise understanding of the balance of power are the keys to victory. After a discovery game you'll be ready for a full and epic game, where an undisputed player will be king by the Assembly for his merit and wisdom.&#10;&#10;While Inis has &quot;dudes&quot; that are &quot;on a map&quot;, it's a beginner's mistake to play this as a battle game because eliminating other clans reduces your chances of scoring a Leadership victory condition. Peace among different clans, with or without a clear territory leader, is the usual outcome of a clan's movement. Battles will occur, of course, as the Celtic clans can be unruly and a good player will listen to his clan's people (i.e., his hand of cards). That battle aspect is reflected in the clan's miniatures representing warriors. Woodsmen, shepherds and traders complete the set of twelve minis for each player; these occupations have no impact on the game, but give it flavor.&#10;&#10;";4;90;14;2;60;Inis;90;2016;Dimitri Bielak,Jim Fitzpatrick;Ancient,Card Game,Mythology;Christian Martinez;Country: Ireland;Area Control / Area Influence,Area Movement,Card Drafting,Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management,Memory,Tile Placement;Matagot,Pegasus Spiele,Portal Games;7.83352;2645;inis;4;3.0;0.0;3.9046881369751327;0;0.2;pPZnlKC4G3;False;24;4.0;90.0;14.0;2.0;60.0;Inis;223;2-4;867;60-90;55.99;89.99;70.99;43.73;9526;2016.0;inis

The killer is one of the investigators! Each player's role and team are randomly assigned at the start of play and include the unique roles of Forensic Scientist, Witness, Investigator, Murderer, and Accomplice. While the Investigators attempt to deduce the truth, the murderer's team must deceive and mislead. This is a battle of wits!&#10;&#10;The Forensic Scientist has the solution but can express the clues only using special scene tiles while the investigators (and the murderer) attempt to interpret the evidence. In order to succeed, the investigators must not only deduce the truth from the clues of the Forensic Scientist, they must also see through the misdirection being injected into the equation by the Murderer and Accomplice!&#10;&#10;Find out who among you can cut through deception to find the truth and who is capable of getting away with murder!&#10;&#10;Roles&#10;&#10;Forensic Scientist x1&#10;As the game master, the Forensic Scientist holds the solution to the crime. They are responsible for assisting the Investigators in identifying the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder.&rdquo; When an Investigator does that successfully, the crime is solved and the Forensic Scientist and the Investigators win the game.&#10;&#10;During the game, the Forensic Scientist is NOT allowed to hint to the solution with words, gestures, or eyes.&#10;&#10;Murderer x1&#10;When the crime takes place, the Murderer chooses 1 Clue card and 1 Means card as the solution to the crime.

Even if they are identified, the Murderer still wins the game if no one correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Means of Murder&rdquo;.&#10;&#10;Investigators x8&#10;To solve the crime, the Investigators must analyze the hints given by the Forensic Scientist. As long as one of the Investigators correctly identifies both the &ldquo;Key Evidence&rdquo; and &ldquo;Means of Murder,&rdquo; the Murderer is arrested and the Investigators win the game (as does the Forensic Scientist).&#10;&#10;Bear in mind that the Murderer (and sometimes Accomplice) is among the Investigators!

In both cases, you will have to deal with the slithering Nightmares, which haunt the hallways of the labyrinth.&#10;&#10;Onirim is a solo/cooperative card game. You (and a partner, if you wish) must work (together) against the game to gather the eight Door cards before the deck runs out; you can obtain those Door cards either by playing cards of the same color three turns in a row, or by discarding (under specific circumstances) one of your powerful Key cards. In both cases you will have to decide the best use of each card in your hand and carefully play around the Nightmares. Those cards are hidden in the deck and will trigger painful dilemmas when drawn...&#10;&#10;Seven mini-expansions, all standalone and compatible with one another, are included with the second edition of Onirim, including these three that were in the first edition of the game:&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Towers&quot; introduces a new type of card that allows more searching and deck manipulation, while also imposing an additional victory condition.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;Happy Dreams and Dark Premonitions&quot; adds evil time bombs that will impede your progress at predictable moments of your quest as well as helpful but unreliable allies.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    In &quot;The Book of Steps Lost and Found&quot;, you must find the eight Door cards in a randomly given order and may remove discarded cards from the game to cast powerful spells that will help you complete this difficult task.&#10;&#10;&#10;Apart from these three from the first edition, there are four new modules in the Onirim 2nd edition box. Just like previously, each module consists of something that makes the game easier and something that makes the game harder:&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Glyphs&quot; introduces a fourth symbol on location cards (apart from Key, Sun and Moon), which makes it easier to compose the row of unrepeated symbols. Player must then find one extra door of each color (so 12 doors in total) to win&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Dreamcatchers&quot; are four cards that &quot;guard&quot; the Limbo piles. The Limbo pile stays with Dreamcatcher until some effect allows the player to shuffle the pile back to the deck... if all Dreamcatchers are full and new cards should come to Limbo, a Dreamcatcher is discarded and his cards shuffled back. Also, four new &quot;Lost Dreams&quot; cards are supposed to be in Limbo at the end of the game, as an extra winning condition - so discarding all Dreamcatchers means loss.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Crossroads and Dead Ends&quot; introduce location cards with a given symbol (3 Sun, 2 Moon, 1 Key), but serving as any color &quot;joker&quot;. It also contains 10 &quot;Dead End&quot; cards, that remain in players hand (un-discard-able on its own) and block her 5-cards hand limit... until a player discards the whole hand (=the only way to discard a Dead End).&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    &quot;The Door To The Oniverse&quot; brings several one-time abilities cards as &quot;inhabitants of the Oniverse&quot;... and one extra colorless door to find.&#10;&#10;&#10;Apart from all those, there are a few special rules to use the dark meeple in the game (which interferes with Nightmare cards resolving), making the game easier or harder, depending on the chosen variant.&#10;&#10;";2;15;14;1;15;Onirim (second edition);15;2014;Philippe Guérin,Élise Plessis;Card Game,Exploration,Fantasy;Shadi Torbey;Oniverse,Solitaire Games;Card Drafting,Co-operative Play,Hand Management,Set Collection;Filosofia Éditions,Hobby Japan,Pegasus Spiele,Z-Man Games;7.36142;2880;onirim (second edition);4;0.0;0.0;3.456565656565657;0;0.0;MUYREDyWSE;False;0;2.0;15.0;10.0;1.0;15.0;Onirim (Second Edition);99;1-2;1530;15;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;1479;2014.0;onirim (second edition)

If everyone accepts the factoid as true, then play passes to the left. If someone challenges the factoid, then that player has two minutes to disprove the statement using whatever electronic device is handy. The winner in the challenge scores one point.

If a trade ship arrives, an auction is held for its wares. &#10;     Assign hunters: Hunters are assigned to hunting grounds, resource gathering, colonizing the New World, raiding other tribes for wives or animals, or promotion to an elder.&#10;     Negotiate: Players can bribe others to peacefully withdraw hunters, including marrying them to their daughters. Players with a War Chief Elder can use hunters to attack others on the same card. The New World turns hostile if there are too many colonists.&#10;     Resolve hunting: Roll a die for each hunter and modify it for technologies and marriages. Success can result in gaining new hunters, resources, hand cards, wives, and/or technologies.

Even as you lead your bravest warriors into battle, you must plan for the future, establishing a presence on planets before the tides of war consume them in blood and fire. You must conquer the Traxis sector by strength of arms for in the grim darkness of the far future, there is only war.&#10;&#10;Warhammer 40,000: Conquest introduces seven distinct factions: Space Marines, Astra Militarum, Orks, Chaos, Dark Eldar, Eldar, and Tau. Each of these factions possesses a unique flavor and style of play, and an alignment wheel introduces the possibility of forming an alliance between two factions.&#10;&#10;At the start of play, the Traxis sector lies open before you, with planets awaiting the tramp of armies on the road to war. Each round begins with you and your opponent preparing for battle. Planet cards are arranged in a row between the players at the beginning of the game, and the planet farthest to the left of the starting player is the first planet. Each round, you or your opponent will clash at the first planet, and the victor will capture the first planet.&#10;&#10;Capturing planets is your ultimate goal. Some planets possess essential materials necessary for the armies of the 41st millennium. Others offer strategic advantages to those who hold them, while yet others are home to great technological wealth. Each of the planet cards possesses one or more symbols in the upper left hand corner, designating that planet's assets. These symbols grant no abilities by themselves, but the first player to collect three planets sharing a common symbol dominates the sector and wins the game.&#10;&#10;Your warlord grants powerful special abilities, determines your starting resources and hand size, and serves as a vital part of your army, so you'll want to build your deck around your warlord to take full advantage of his strengths &mdash; and cover his weaknesses, as defeating the opponent's warlord is another way to victory.&#10;&#10;";2;45;14;2;45;Warhammer 40,000: Conquest;45;2014;Víctor Pérez Corbella,Alex Drummond;Card Game,Collectible Components,Fighting;Brad Andres,Nate French,Eric M.

Your goal is to build the most efficient hospital in three dimensions in order to get the most popularity. You will manage the construction of the building from scratch as well as the installation of new services and the recruitment of the best doctors, nurses and administrative staff that align with the arrival of new patients. You will also be attentive to the well-being of patients and not forget that time is also money when competing with neighboring hospitals...&#10;&#10;Each turn in Clinic, players take three actions &mdash; building in different modules; hosting patients; hiring doctors, nurses and staff &mdash; by playing one card. Each cube that enters the clinic comes with a car that needs to be parked, leaving less space for the hospital being constructed! During the game, you'll move patients, doctors, nurses, and staff in the 3D structure as efficiently as you can in order to save time, with doctors and nurses tending to patients as long as their colors (indicating both training and illness) match. By taking care of patients you receive money, which lets you pay fees, salaries and maintenance as well as buy popularity points.&#10;&#10;During an administrative phase, uncared for patients grow sicker, new patients enter the pre-admission room, doctors become less knowledgable about the diseases they face, and new doctors and nurses become available from their schools.

931;9045;156858;"As Hitler's grasp on Germany tightens and his maniacal fervor is unmasked, men from the highest levels of the Reich begin to plot his assassination. As the clock ticks and Hitler's ambitions grow, these daring few must build their strength and prepare for the perfect moment to strike. The Gestapo hound their trail, calling these conspirators &quot;Schwarze Kapelle&quot;, the Black Orchestra. Will this band of daring patriots save their country from utter ruin before it is too late?&#10;&#10;Black Orchestra begins with each player choosing an historic figure involved in the conspiracy against Hitler. In this dark and dangerous pursuit, motivation is perhaps your greatest weapon. If you can stay true to your convictions in the face of overwhelming threat and inspire your comrades, then you will be able to use your special ability, attempt plots, and even become zealous (necessary for some extremely daring plots).&#10;&#10;But every move you make may also increase the suspicion of the authorities. The Gestapo will make routine sweeps, and any players with high suspicion will be arrested and interrogated (possibly resulting in other players being arrested). If you are all arrested or if the Gestapo finds your secret papers, you lose. And the suspicion placed on each conspirator will increase the chances their plots are detected.&#10;&#10;On a turn, players may take three actions, such as moving, searching for an item, or drawing a card; or, at the cost of one action per die, roll the dice in an attempt to gain even more actions &mdash; at the risk of attracting the suspicion of the gestapo. This dice rolling &quot;Conspire&quot; action allows players to make bold moves when most needed.&#10;&#10;After the actions have been taken, an event card is drawn. The game is played over seven stages of World War 2, represented by seven stacks of event cards. These cards walk you through the events of WWII in a roughly (but not strictly) chronological order. New stages open up new areas of the board, cause Hitler and his deputies to interact with the Conspirators, and present various opportunities or threats. During the final stage, many board spaces become off-limits, as the Allies move closer to Germany.&#10;&#10;To win, players must collect a plot card and fulfill all necessary requirements listed (such as having Hitler be in a certain space and possessing certain items--detonator &amp; fuse, etc.). The active player may then attempt the plot by rolling the indicated dice, including all additional modifiers and helpful Action cards. The total of number of &quot;Target&quot; symbols needed to kill Hitler is based on Hitler's military support, but a Conspirator's security level decides if any &quot;Eagles&quot; rolled will see them detected, and foil the plot regardless. Players must consider their ability to successfully complete a plot and the relative suspicion levels of the different Conspirators involved.&#10;&#10;Players will need to work together and agree on the wisest course of action, as well as have a little luck, to succeed. The phenomenon of one player dominating the game because of it's cooperative nature is mitigated by the fact that there are no certainties, and often a player will need to make a bold or reckless move to keep the conspiracy alive. Cool heads often prevail, but play it too cool and you may miss your chance. The co-operative dynamic gets really interesting if a player is ever arrested, and fails to resist interrogation, then they will need to make a big decision all by themselves, without revealing their options to the group. No one player can guarantee success. It is hoped that players will have tense conversations similar to those had by the real conspirators and enjoy a truly unique historical experience.&#10;&#10;";5;75;13;1;45;Black Orchestra;75;2016;Cody Jones,Dann May,Lucas Soriano;Spies/Secret Agents,World War II;Philip duBarry;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter;Action Point Allowance System,Co-operative Play,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Pick-up and Deliver,Point to Point Movement,Press Your Luck,Set Collection,Variable Player Powers;Game Salute,Ludonova;7.60193;560;black orchestra;17;2.5;2.5;3.5674050632911385;0;0.0;bieRFX1aHW;False;0;5.0;75.0;13.0;1.0;45.0;Black Orchestra;79;1-5;279;45-75;60.0;87.99;56.95;0.0;2039;2016.0;black orchestra

Carefully balance time management and timing to earn the most points in this medium-weight worker placement and resource management game.&#10;&#10;In more detail, over twelve rounds players take turns placing two workers per round, one at a time. The town board and whaling board contain basic game actions: taking goods (food, wood, brick), selling goods, building buildings, docking ships, and launching ships. These actions can be used multiple times per round, with the first player to do so in a round receiving a bonus or more goods or reducing the number of goods paid.&#10;&#10;Most buildings add extra action spaces with new actions, combined actions, and more powerful versions of basic actions. You own whatever you build, with others needing to pay to use them and you earning points from them at game's end.&#10;&#10;You need to pay to send ships whaling, choosing how far out to send them. At the end of the round, ships move closer to shore and whale tokens are drawn randomly. Ships that are farthest out have first chance to pick the valuable sperm whales, but as they move in, others have the opportunity to launch farther out and get a better pick, possibly leaving you with only empty seas. Over the course of the game, whales become more rare and empty seas more common. Once a ship reaches shore, a percentage of the profits (the &quot;lay&quot;) must be paid in order to keep the whales selected.&#10;&#10;After twelve rounds, all ships must return, and players total their points from buildings, whales, and extra money.

Will the players, as powerful gods, allow him to do it?&#10;&#10;From the first turn, the players are tossed in the middle of war. They will feel the adrenaline, fear, pain and the heat of a battle. They will smell blood and sweat, hear the clash of arms and the moaning of wounded and dying.&#10;&#10;The Lord of the Ice Garden takes place on The Coast of Sails, which is divided into several regions. The main goal is fighting for the domination over those regions. A region is dominated by the player with the most influence in it. Dominating the region allows players to collect its resources (M-factor, gold, population), also to win victory points in specific turns, and to accomplish their own goals. Each player has unique winning conditions and special units.&#10;&#10;&#10;    Olaf Fjollsfinn &ndash; uses Ice Drakkars to seduce/kidnap six dwellers of The Coast of Sails to the Ice Garden.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Passionaria Callo &ndash; sends nightmares on the controlled regions and tries to isolate them. She needs to isolate two of them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Pier van Dyken &ndash; greedy collector of M-factor. When he dominates a region with  a magical reserve, he may move it towards his headquarters, The Thorn. He needs to absorb four magical reserves.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Ulrike Freihoff &ndash; spreads her religion. When she dominates a region where she also has a special unit called The Enlightened One, she may build a Red Tower there. Six of those grant her victory.&#10;&#10;&#10;There is also Vuko, who came to evacuate the scientists and clean up their mess. Each turn he goes to the region, where the player with least reputation/morality (it decreases each time the player uses magic) has the most influence. Such a visit is nothing nice &ndash; Vuko kills one special unit of that player in this region and lowers his/her influence there.&#10;&#10;The game may end in one of the three ways:&#10;&#10;    Meeting the player's unique victory condition &ndash; the game ends and that player is the winner,&#10;    After specified number of turns game ends and the player with most victory points is the winner,&#10;    The Dead Snow token reaches the end of its track &ndash; each use of magic shakes the balance of Midgaard. If the players exceed the limit of changes that world and its gods can accept, the game ends and the winner is the player with the highest reputation.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;INITIATIVE PHASE:&#10;During the initiative phase players decide how many action tokens they will have for the current turn and also determine the player order during the Planning Phase. Moreover, they can initiate scoring of the regions by moving their initiative tokens. In the advanced mode they also determine the order of action fields resolution.&#10;&#10;PLANNING PHASE:&#10;Players, one by one in the order determined in the Initiative Phase, place their action tokens on selected action fields.&#10;&#10;ACTION PHASE:&#10;Players perform actions in the action fields, in the order determined by the placement of tokens.&#10;&bull; Viper's Nest &ndash; player receives one token of any resource. They can also exchange resources.&#10;&bull; Influence &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two population tokens to place as many influence tokens on the region(s) where they already have at least one influence&#10;&bull; Move &ndash; player may sacrifice up to two gold tokens to make as many moves of their influence tokens and/or special units to the neighboring region(s)&#10;&bull; Voracious Mountain &ndash; player may sacrifice population to move any number of their influence tokens and/or special units from one region to any other region&#10;&bull; Raven's Shadow &ndash; player may raise his/her reputation or use a magic token to get rid of the disadvantageous token of contact with Vuko.&#10;&bull; Magic &ndash; allows the player to do any of the three actions: translocate the M-factor, summon special units of the given level, add a new ability to the special unit. Each of those actions results in moving the Dead Snow token up on its track and decreasing the player's reputation.&#10;&bull; Activation (automatic field) &ndash; after resolving the actions players may activate the abilities of their special units. The order of activation of given abilities is strictly determined. After the activation the situation on the board may change drastically.&#10;&bull; Vuko Drakkainen (automatic field) &ndash; each turn Vuko must go to another region. Its figure is placed in the region, where the most immoral player has the most influence. That player receives a conact token decreasing his/her influence, and also loses one special unit in this region (provided he/she had any). In the advanced mode players will be able to equip Vuko with more abilities, that will activate in specific moments of the game.&#10;&#10;DOMINATION PHASE:&#10;Players collect victory points and resources from the regions, and accomplish their unique goals.&#10;&#10;";4;90;14;1;90;The Lord of the Ice Garden;90;2014;Dominik Kasprzycki;Fantasy,Fighting,Medieval,Mythology,Science Fiction;Krzysztof Wolicki;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Crowdfunding: Spieleschmiede,Crowdfunding: Wspieram;Action / Movement Programming,Action Point Allowance System,Area Control / Area Influence,Variable Phase Order,Variable Player Powers,Worker Placement;REDIMP GAMES;7.7644199999999985;536;the lord of the ice garden;44;0.0;0.0;3.875;0;0.0;epYE3AzGWD;False;0;4.0;90.0;14.0;1.0;90.0;The Lord of the Ice Garden;12;1-4;35;90;0.0;0.0;330.99;0.0;304;2014.0;the lord of the ice garden

Players, in the role of merchants, see this as an opportunity to make quick profits by selling goods in the bustling city during the Prince's visit. However, players must first get their goods through the city gate, which is under the watch of the Sheriff of Nottingham. Should you play it safe with legal goods and make a profit, or risk it all by sneaking in illicit goods? Be mindful, though, as the Sheriff always has his eyes out for liars and tricksters and if he catches one, he very well may confiscate those goods for himself!&#10;&#10;In Sheriff of Nottingham, players will not only be able to experience Nottingham as a merchant of the city, but each turn one player will step into the shoes of the Sheriff himself.

After a few minutes, gunfire and hurrying footsteps on the roof can be heard. Heavily armed bandits have come to rob honest citizens of their wallets and jewels. Will they succeed in stealing the suitcase holding the Nice Valley Coal Company's weekly pay, despite it having been placed under the supervision of Marshal Samuel Ford? Will these bandits hinder one another more than the Marshal since only the richest one of them can come out on top?&#10;&#10;In Colt Express, you play a bandit robbing a train at the same time as other bandits, and your goal is to become the richest outlaw of the Old West. The game consists of five rounds, and each round has two phases:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Phase 1: Schemin' Each player plays 2-5 action cards on a common pile, with the cards being face up or face down depending on the type of the round. Instead of playing a card, a player can draw three cards from her deck.&#10;    Phase 2: Stealin' The action cards are carried out in the order they were played, with a player's best laid plans possibly not panning out due to mistakes and oversights!&#10;&#10;&#10;The game takes place in a 3D train in which the bandits can move from one car to another, run on the roof, punch the other bandits, shoot them, rob the passengers, or draw the Marshal out of position. The train has as many cars as the number of players, and each car is seeded with gems, bags of loot or suitcases at the start of play.&#10;&#10;Each player starts a round with six cards in hand, with each card showing one of these actions. At the start of a round, a round card is revealed, showing how many cards will be played; whether they'll be played face up or face down, or individually or in pairs; and what action will occur at the end of the round (e.g., all bandits on top of the train move to the engine). You can pick up loot, gems or suitcases only by playing a &quot;steal&quot; card when you're in a train car that holds one of these items &mdash; but since everyone is planning to get these goods, you'll need to move, punch and shoot to get others out of your way. You can punch someone only in the same car as you, and when you do, the other bandit drops one of the goods he's collected and is knocked into an adjacent car.&#10;&#10;Each player's character has a special power, such as starting the round with an extra card, playing your first card face down, or pocketing a bag of loot when you punch someone instead of letting it hit the ground.&#10;&#10;You can shoot someone in an adjacent car or (if you're running on top of the train) anyone in sight, and when you do, you give that player one of your six bullet cards; that card gets shuffled in the opponent's deck, possibly giving her a dead card in hand on a future turn and forcing her to draw instead of playing something. If the Marshal ends up in the same car as you, likely due to other bandits luring him through the train, he'll be happy to give you a bullet, too.&#10;&#10;At the end of the game, whoever fired the most bullets receives a $1,000 braggart bonus, and whoever bagged the richest haul wins!&#10;&#10;";6;40;10;2;30;Colt Express;40;2014;Ian Parovel,Jordi Valbuena;American West,Fighting,Trains;Christophe Raimbault;3D Games;Action / Movement Programming,Hand Management,Memory,Modular Board,Take That,Variable Player Powers;Ludonaute,Asmodee,Asterion Press,Gém Klub Kft.,GoKids 玩樂小子,Hobby Japan,KADABRA,Kaissa Chess & Games,Lautapelit.fi,MINDOK,REBEL.pl;7.242380000000002;11881;colt express;2;0.0;0.0;3.3686047794117635;0;0.2;gfcOYEnOG4;False;0;6.0;45.0;10.0;2.0;30.0;Colt Express;272;2-6;1298;30-45;31.99;44.87;36.97;23.05;1689;2014.0;colt express

Each enemy presents a tough choice to you, your team, and ultimately the whole village!

So you need to balance your time between keeping the ships system's online, fending off the alien threat, and completing your objective.&#10;&#10;Each member of your crew has special abilities and skills. You need to work as a group to maximize the potential of each role.

955;9169;160010;"Conan, designed by Fred Henry and based on the Conan universe by Robert E. Howard, is a scenario-based semi-cooperative asymmetric miniatures board game. One player is the Opponent, playing the Opposition forces, and the other players (1 to 4) play Conan and his companions: Shevatas the thief, Hadrathus the Priest/Sorcerer, Belit the pirate queen, Valeria the warrior, etc. The game is based purely on Robert E. Howard's novels and short stories (and not the movies or other non-Howardian material). The publisher has hired Patrice Louinet, a Howard expert, to make sure the art and the scenarios are compatible with Howard's vision.&#10;&#10;Each game is a scenario, played on a map. There will be several maps &mdash; Pictish Village, Underground temple, Tavern, Pirate ship, etc. &mdash; and each map can have several scenarios set on it. The game is fast, one hour approximately. It's possible to play several scenarios in a campaign, but you can also play each scenario individually. There will be a dozen playable scenarios in the base box.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of a scenario, players choose their team (Conan and two or three other heroes). The Opponent gathers all the miniatures (picts, Necromancer, skeleton warriors, monsters, etc.), tokens, cards from the chosen scenario. The game usually plays in a limited number of turns (ten, for instance). Each scenario can have very different objectives: find the princess captured by picts and hidden in a hut and leave the camp before the pict hunters return; find the magical key to open a sealed door, steal the jewel and leave; kill the Necromancer by the end of turn 10; survive by the end of turn 10; escape the prison; etc.&#10;&#10;During their turn, the heroes can activate or rest. If they activate, they can spend &quot;gems&quot; from their energy pool to do all sorts of actions: move, fight (melee or distance), defend, pick a lock, reroll, etc. If they rest, they can move a lot of gems from their &quot;spent&quot; pool box to their &quot;available&quot; pool box. When they take an action, they throw a number of dice equal to the number of gems they put in their action. There are three different kinds of dice: yellow (the weaker dice), orange (medium) and red (strong). Each character has a color based on their specialty: Conan throws red dice in combat while the Sorcerer throws yellow dice in combat; the thief throws red dice in Manipulation actions, while Conan throws orange dice; etc. Each player can have equipment cards (armor, magic potions, weapons, etc.) which give them bonuses on their dice rolls.&#10;&#10;The Opponent plays differently. He uses a board with eight slidable tiles, plus his own Energy gems. Each tile corresponds to one unit (1 to 3 miniatures) on the game mat, and all of the miniature abilities are written on this tile (movement, armor, attack, special abilities). The tile position on the board corresponds to the numbers 1-8. The Opponent has a pool of energy gems and each time he activates one unit, he needs to spend a number of gems matching the tile placement: tile#1 costs 1 energy gem, tile#2 costs 2 gems, etc. Whatever tile the Opponent chooses to activate, he spends the corresponding energy cost (moving his energy gems from the available pool to the spent pool), then takes the tile out and moves it to the end of the sliding track: If he wants to activate this unit again, it will cost him 8 gems, because the unit is now on position 8. The Opponent can activate a maximum of two tiles, and he regains only a certain number of gems each turn (depending on the scenario).&#10;&#10;In a typical scenario, the heroes need to accomplish something and the Opponent wins if the heroes fail to reach their objective &mdash; but in some scenarios, the Opponent has his own objectives and the Heroes win if they prevent him from accomplishing his goal.&#10;&#10;Components (according to the back of the box):&#10;&#10;     16 spell cards (in either English or French)&#10;     39 equipment cards (in either English or French)&#10;     60 tiles (actually 75, see below)&#10;     161 tokens&#10;     8 Hero sheets (one side in English, the other in French)&#10;     4 player aid sheets (one side in English, the other in French)&#10;     1 turn counter sheet (both sides in English)&#10;     1 Hero rule book (in either English or French)&#10;     1 Overlord rulebook (13 scenarios) (in either English or French)&#10;     2 map boards&#10;     15 dice&#10;     75 &quot;gems&quot; (blue and red)&#10;     25 coloured bases (5 each in red, orange, green, blue, purple)&#10;     106 miniatures (plastic)&#10;     1 Overlord board (plastic)&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;The tiles need to be looked at more closely. 13 come in English-French pairs, another 35 are in the edition's language (either French or English), and the remaining 14 tiles come in non-lingual pairs (two each of Khosatral Khel, Skuthus, Thak, Zaporavo, and Zogar Sag, plus four Thog). A functional set of tiles is thus 62 strong, the remaining 27 tiles being set aside.

In every game, you and your opponent match wits and resources over key events. If you can thwart your opponent, you claim the event, bringing you closer to victory. Whether you seek to triumph through military might, or use diplomacy to achieve your ends, the fate of the galaxy rests in your hands.&#10;&#10;On one side of this galactic battleground are the heroes of the Rebel Alliance. Only rarely can these heroes go toe to toe with the unlimited reserves of the Imperial Navy and Army. Instead, the iconic characters of Star Wars and the unsung heroes of the Rebellion must work in secret, utilizing diplomacy, reconnaissance, and the Force to achieve their aims. Even when the Rebellion deploys its full military strength to win a battle or destroy a key Imperial emplacement, they need the groundwork put in place by Alliance Special Forces.&#10;&#10;Opposing the heroic endeavors of the Rebel Alliance is the massive power of the Empire, led by the twisted Emperor. The dark side of the Force is strong with the Emperor and Darth Vader, and the military might of the Empire is unparalleled across the galaxy. Whether you undertake aggressive negotiations or hire bounty hunters and scum to ferret out Rebel spies, making the Empire the ultimate power in the galaxy rests in your hands.&#10;&#10;To successfully win these struggles and reclaim the galaxy in Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion, you will need to utilize all of your resources. Every turn, you can increase your faction&rsquo;s presence at the current event by drawing the top card from your deck and putting it into play. Each resource card you play give you more power and brings you closer to the objective value of the current event. As an example, the resource card shown to the right has a resource value of five, which it contributes to your total resource value while in play. Playing more resource cards may bring you closer to your target, but it also makes your efforts more obvious. If your total resource value ever passes the event&rsquo;s objective value, your forces are discovered and your opponent claims the event.&#10;&#10;Instead of playing a new resource card, you can also trigger the power of a resource card currently in play, exercising the might of the Empire or the cunning of the Rebel Alliance. To activate a resource card&rsquo;s power, you must exhaust it by rotating it 90 degrees clockwise. Once a card is exhausted, you can't use its power unless it becomes ready again. In addition, an exhausted card contributes its exhausted resource value, shown in the lower left-hand corner of the card while the resource is ready.&#10;&#10;";2;60;10;2;60;Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion;60;2014;;Bluffing,Card Game,Movies / TV / Radio theme,Science Fiction;Sébastien Gigaudaut,David Rakoto,Nikki Valens;Star Wars;Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management,Memory,Variable Player Powers;Bergsala Enigma,Delta Vision Publishing,Edge Entertainment,Fantasy Flight Games,Galakta,Galápagos Jogos,Giochi Uniti,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Kaissa Chess & Games;6.48844;1007;star wars: empire vs. rebellion;63;0.0;0.0;3.333333333333333;0;0.36;48d7OB8Xry;False;0;2.0;75.0;10.0;2.0;60.0;Star Wars: Empire vs. Rebellion;24;2;48;60-75;8.24;18.0;16.95;0.0;493;2014.0;star wars: empire vs. rebellion

To face these challenges, you must put on your foreman clothes. Between hiring workers, managing their organization, purchasing slaves or tools, and taking out loans, you'll have to make the right decisions to fulfill your dream: Becoming the greatest builder the age has ever known.&#10;&#10;In the game, players score points (and gain money) by completing the construction of buildings. Each building has four characteristics &mdash; carpentry, masonry, architecture, painting &mdash; rated between 0 and 5, and the workers have the same characteristics valued in the same range. To complete a construction, the player must add enough workers to cover the four characteristics of the building, but placing a worker on a construction site costs money.&#10;&#10;Each turn players have three free actions; however, for an added cost players may also chose to buy additional actions during their turn. Unlike in The Builders: Middle Ages, players can acquire slaves and put them to work, but if they don't pay to free the slaves by the end of the game, they lose points. Other changes from the original game include the ability to send your workers to universities or purchase tools to improve their characteristics.&#10;&#10;Make use of your workers, of your slaves, or your freed slaves to build your buildings and amass victory points to ultimately be named the greatest builder of all!&#10;&#10;";4;30;10;2;30;The Builders: Antiquity;30;2015;Sabrina Miramon;Ancient,City Building;Frédéric Henry;;Action Point Allowance System,Card Drafting,Set Collection;Bombyx,Asmodee,Gém Klub Kft.,REBEL.pl;6.91568;600;the builders: antiquity;90;0.0;0.0;3.5015789473684213;0;0.2;avZVWFIiTc;False;0;4.0;45.0;10.0;2.0;30.0;The Builders: Antiquity;19;2-4;84;30-45;14.39;0.0;19.99;0.0;273;2015.0;the builders: antiquity

This information dictates how a stock&rsquo;s value will change at the end of the round. By privately learning if a stock is going to move up or down, each player has a chance to act ahead of the market by buying or selling at the right time.&#10;&#10;Second, players purchase their stocks by bidding on piles of cards called stockpiles. These stockpiles will contain a mixture of face-up and face-down cards placed by other players in the game. In this way, nobody will know all of the cards in the stockpiles. Not all cards are good either. Trading fees can poison the piles by making players pay more than they bid. By putting stocks and other cards up for auction, Stockpile catalyzes player interaction, especially when potential profits from insider information are on the line.&#10;&#10;Both of these mechanisms are combined with some stock market elements to make players consider multiple factors when selling a stock. Do you hold onto a stock in hopes of catching a lucrative stock split or do you sell now to avoid the potential company bankruptcy? Can you hold onto your stock until the end of the game to become the majority shareholder, or do you need the liquidity of cash now for future bidding? Do you risk it all by investing heavily into one company, or do you mitigate your risk by diversifying your portfolio?&#10;&#10;In the end, everyone knows something about the stock market, so it all comes down to strategy execution. Will you be able to navigate the movements of the stock market with certainty? Or will your investments go under from poor predictions?&#10;&#10;";5;45;13;2;45;Stockpile;45;2015;Jacqui Davis,Ian O'Toole;Economic;Brett Sobol,Seth Van Orden;Crowdfunding: Kickstarter;Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Stock Holding,Variable Player Powers;GoKids 玩樂小子,Nauvoo Games;7.655089999999999;2520;stockpile;59;3.0;3.0;3.7627272727272727;0;-3.0;7TsBpyt02g;False;0;5.0;60.0;13.0;2.0;45.0;Stockpile;110;2-5;690;45-60;199.99;0.0;44.99;0.0;2279;2015.0;stockpile

The dividends are paid out to shareholders of certain railroads based on how many cities/towns they connect to and how many shares of this company have been issued. The upgrade and dividend actions also affect game length and the likelihood of further dividends for each company.

966;9240;161926;"Dead Drop is a game that involves elements of memory, deduction, and crafty maneuvering. As secret agents working for different organizations, players scour the globe seeking information that will help them find the location of a hidden explosive device. Agents must trade information and sell secrets in order to learn the location of the device and grab it before it falls into the hands of another agency! On a player's turn, you must choose one of the following actions:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Share Info: Trade one card from your hand with one card from any other agent. The target agent must trade and may not look at the card she is being given before handing over her card to the active agent.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Hack the Cache: Trade one card from your hand with one card in the cache. The card from your hand becomes a part of the cache and should be face up.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Sell Secrets: Reveal two cards from your hand to another agent, who must then answer &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; to reveal whether or not she has a card equal to the sum of those cards. If she says &quot;yes&quot;, she must hand a card of that value to the active agent in exchange for one of the cards shown. The active agent chooses which card to hand over.&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a turn, after performing a regular action, the active agent may choose to Grab The Drop: Place two cards from your hand face up next to the card in the middle of the table. Then, secretly look at the card in the middle to determine whether this card is equal to the sum of the two face-up cards. If you guessed correctly, you win the round; if you're wrong, you're out of the round. (In a three- or four-player game, if an agent is eliminated, she must place her cards face up in front of her. Other agents may trade with an eliminated agent's cards by placing the card traded from their hand face up in place of the card they take.) The first player to win three rounds wins the game.&#10;&#10;&bull;&bull;&bull;&#10;&#10;Dead Drop includes three sets of cards with different artwork (Spies, Monsters, and Kids).

967;9242;161936;"Pandemic Legacy is a co-operative campaign game, with an overarching story-arc played through 12-24 sessions, depending on how well your group does at the game. At the beginning, the game starts very similar to basic Pandemic, in which your team of disease-fighting specialists races against the clock to travel around the world, treating disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they get out of hand.&#10;&#10;During a player's turn, they have four actions available, with which they may travel around in the world in various ways (sometimes needing to discard a card), build structures like research stations, treat diseases (removing one cube from the board; if all cubes of a color have been removed, the disease has been eradicated), trade cards with other players, or find a cure for a disease (requiring five cards of the same color to be discarded while at a research station). Each player has a unique role with special abilities to help them at these actions.&#10;&#10;After a player has taken their actions, they draw two cards. These cards can include epidemic cards, which will place new disease cubes on the board, and can lead to an outbreak, spreading disease cubes even further. Outbreaks additionally increase the panic level of a city, making that city more expensive to travel to.&#10;&#10;Each month in the game, you have two chances to achieve that month's objectives. If you succeed, you win and immediately move on to the next month. If you fail, you have a second chance, with more funding for beneficial event cards.&#10;&#10;During the campaign, new rules and components will be introduced. These will sometimes require you to permanently alter the components of the game; this includes writing on cards, ripping up cards, and placing permanent stickers on components. Your characters can gain new skills, or detrimental effects. A character can even be lost entirely, at which point it's no longer available for play.&#10;&#10;";4;60;13;2;60;Pandemic Legacy: Season 1;60;2015;Chris Quilliams;Environmental,Medical;Rob Daviau,Matt Leacock;Campaign Games,Legacy,Pandemic;Action Point Allowance System,Co-operative Play,Hand Management,Point to Point Movement,Set Collection,Trading,Variable Player Powers;Z-Man Games,Asterion Press,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Gém Klub Kft.,Hobby Japan,Jolly Thinkers,Lacerta,Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd,MINDOK;8.66878;17251;pandemic legacy: season 1;1;2.8;3.2;4.224844551710937;0;0.25;mce5HZPnF5;False;0;4.0;75.0;13.0;2.0;60.0;Pandemic Legacy: Season 1;478;2-4;5135;60-75;59.95;87.77;78.97;63.99;4680;2015.0;pandemic legacy: season 1
968;9246;161970;"In Alchemists, two to four budding alchemists compete to discover the secrets of their mystical art. Points can be earned in various ways, but most points are earned by publishing theories &ndash; correct theories, that is &mdash; and therein lies the problem.&#10;&#10;The game is played in six rounds. At the beginning of the round, players choose their play order. Those who choose to play later get more rewards.&#10;Players declare all their actions by placing cubes on the various action spaces, then each action space is evaluated in order. Players gain knowledge by mixing ingredients and testing the results using a smartphone app (iOS, Android, and also Windows) that randomizes the rules of alchemy for each new game. And if the alchemists are longing for something even more special, they can always buy magical artifacts to get an extra push. There are 9 of them (different for each game) and they are not only very powerful, but also very expensive. But money means nothing, when there's academic pride at stake! And the possession of these artifacts will definitely earn you some reputation too. Players can also earn money by selling potions of questionable quality to adventurers, but money is just a means to an end. The alchemists don't want riches, after all. They want respect, and respect usually comes from publishing theories.&#10;&#10;During play, players' reputations will go up and down. After six rounds and a final exhibition, reputation will be converted into points. Points will also be scored for artifacts and grants. Then the secrets of alchemy are revealed and players score points or lose points based on whether their theories were correct. Whoever has the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;Flavor text:&#10;Mandrake root and scorpion tail; spongy mushroom and warty toad &mdash; these are the foundations of the alchemist's livelihood, science, and art.&#10;&#10;But what arcane secrets do these strange ingredients hide?

Gain riches selling potions to wandering adventurers and invest these riches in powerful artifacts. As your knowledge grows, so will your reputation, as you publish your theories for all to see.

Players also have the option of discarding drafted cards for dice or cogs to power their invention, but they must make this tricky choice when each card is drafted.&#10;&#10;Then, after venting dice to revitalize their machines, players roll their dice and use them to activate machine parts which provide things like movement, shielding, and additional dice with which to activate more parts.

Each player takes five buttons &mdash; the currency/points in the game &mdash; and someone is chosen as the start player.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player either purchases one of the three patches standing clockwise of the spool or passes.

You're free to place the patch anywhere on your board that doesn't overlap other patches, but you probably want to fit things together as tightly as possible. If your time token is behind or on top of the other player's time token, then you take another turn; otherwise the opponent now goes. Instead of purchasing a patch, you can choose to pass; to do this, you move your time token to the space immediately in front of the opponent's time token, then take one button from the bank for each space you moved.&#10;&#10;In addition to a button cost and time cost, each patch also features 0-3 buttons, and when you move your time token past a button on the time track, you earn &quot;button income&quot;: sum the number of buttons depicted on your personal game board, then take this many buttons from the bank.&#10;&#10;What's more, the time track depicts five 1x1 patches on it, and during set-up you place five actual 1x1 patches on these spaces.

978;9311;163602;"Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;You are humanity's last hope.&#10;&#10;In XCOM: The Board Game, you and up to three friends assume the roles of the leaders of the elite, international organization known as XCOM. It is your job to defend humanity, quell the rising panic, and turn back the alien invasion.&#10;&#10;Where the world's militaries have failed to stand against the alien invaders, you must succeed. To do so, you must make strategic use of the resources available to you. You must launch Interceptors to shoot down alien UFOs, assign soldiers to key missions, research alien technology, and use that technology to defend your base &mdash; all while trying to keep the world from collapsing just long enough that you can coordinate one final mission to repel the invaders for good.&#10;&#10;One of the more notable aspects of XCOM: The Board Game is the way that it incorporates a free and innovative digital app into the core of its gameplay. This digital companion will be available both as a downloadable app and as an online tool.&#10;&#10;The app's primary function is to coordinate the escalating alien invasion, randomly selecting from one of five different invasion plans. Each invasion plan represents a general outline that the alien commanders will use to coordinate the arrival of new UFOs, plan strikes against your base, and respond to your successes or failures as it seeks to conquer Earth. The app manages all of these tasks and heightens the game's tension as it forces you to respond in real-time. Then, after you move quickly to coordinate your response, you engage the enemy in the untimed resolution phase and feed the results to the app. Based upon these results, the app launches the invasion's next strikes.&#10;&#10;Additionally, the app teaches you the rules, controls the information that your satellites provide you, and tracks the progress of your resistance efforts, even as it allows you to enjoy the game at any of three levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, or Hard.&#10;&#10;The use of this app does more than simply streamline your play experience and track your turns in real-time; it also permits a uniquely dynamic turn structure. While the variety of game phases remains the same from round to round, the order in which you and your friends must play through them may change, as may the number of a given phase. As a result, while you'll want to know where UFOs appear before you deploy your Interceptors, the alien invaders may be able to disrupt your satellite intel and force you to deploy your Interceptors on patrol with limited or no knowledge of the UFOs current whereabouts. Similarly, you may be forced to think about the costs of resolving the world&rsquo;s crises before you know how many troops you&rsquo;ll need to commit to your base defense.&#10;&#10;The effect of the app is to immerse you deep into the dramatic tension at the core of XCOM: The Board Game, and it ensures that the game presents a challenging and cooperative (or solo) experience like no other. Just like the XCOM department heads that you represent, you'll need to keep cool heads in order to prevail.&#10;&#10;";4;90;14;1;90;XCOM: The Board Game;90;2015;;Dice,Electronic,Real-time,Science Fiction,Video Game Theme;Eric M.

The game revolves around an innovative dice-rolling combo mechanic. The number of dice you roll is determined by the strength of your galaxy. Each die is engraved with symbols representing the various actions you can take, such as moving a spaceship, increasing your culture or energy resources, or advancing your political or economic influence over newly discovered planets.&#10;&#10;Through careful planning, you must make the most out of your turn, taking the available actions in whichever order you consider most beneficial.

This means that it can always be your turn, even when it is someone else&rsquo;s turn!&#10;&#10;Players will colonize new planets throughout the game, thereby earning victory points and accumulating special abilities which they can activate for their galactic empire. Careful spending of resources will ensure the fastest growth of your empire, while allowing you to receive the biggest possible pay&#226;&#128;&#144;off from the actions you take.&#10;&#10;Will your influence be enough to control the most powerful planets in the galaxy?

The tile might feature a city, a road, a cloister, grassland or some combination thereof, and it must be placed adjacent to tiles that have already been played, in such a way that cities are connected to cities, roads to roads, etcetera. Having placed a tile, the player can then decide to place one of his meeples on one of the areas on it: on the city as a knight, on the road as a robber, on a cloister as a monk, or on the grass as a farmer. When that area is complete, that meeple scores points for its owner.&#10;&#10;During a game of Carcassonne, players are faced with decisions like: &quot;Is it really worth putting my last meeple there?&quot; or &quot;Should I use this tile to expand my city, or should I place it near my opponent instead, giving him a hard time to complete his project and score points?&quot; Since players place only one tile and have the option to place one meeple on it, turns proceed quickly even if it is a game full of options and possibilities.&#10;&#10;This Big Box is the same size as other Big Boxes, but with a slightly different component mix.

Giant corporations, sponsored by the World Government on Earth, initiate huge projects to raise the temperature, the oxygen level, and the ocean coverage until the environment is habitable. In Terraforming Mars, you play one of those corporations and work together in the terraforming process, but compete for getting victory points that are awarded not only for your contribution to the terraforming, but also for advancing human infrastructure throughout the solar system, and doing other commendable things.&#10;&#10;The players acquire unique project cards (from over two hundred different ones) by buying them to their hand. The projects (cards) can represent anything from introducing plant life or animals, hurling asteroids at the surface, building cities, to mining the moons of Jupiter and establishing greenhouse gas industries to heat up the atmosphere. The cards can give you immediate bonuses, as well as increasing your production of different resources. Many cards also have requirements and they become playable when the temperature, oxygen, or ocean coverage increases enough. Buying cards is costly, so there is a balance between buying cards (3 megacredits per card) and actually playing them (which can cost anything between 0 to 41 megacredits, depending on the project). Standard Projects are always available to complement your cards.&#10;&#10;Your basic income, as well as your basic score, is based on your Terraform Rating (starting at 20), which increases every time you raise one of the three global parameters. However, your income is complemented with your production, and you also get VPs from many other sources.&#10;&#10;Each player keeps track of their production and resources on their player boards, and the game uses six types of resources: MegaCredits, Steel, Titanium, Plants, Energy, and Heat. On the game board, you compete for the best places for your city tiles, ocean tiles, and greenery tiles. You also compete for different Milestones and Awards worth many VPs. Each round is called a generation (guess why) and consists of the following phases:&#10;&#10;1) Player order shifts clockwise.&#10;2) Research phase: All players buy cards from four privately drawn.&#10;3) Action phase: Players take turns doing 1-2 actions from these options: Playing a card, claiming a Milestone, funding an Award, using a Standard project, converting plant into greenery tiles (and raising oxygen), converting heat into a temperature raise, and using the action of a card in play. The turn continues around the table (sometimes several laps) until all players have passed.&#10;4) Production phase: Players get resources according to their terraform rating and production parameters.&#10;&#10;When the three global parameters (temperature, oxygen, ocean) have all reached their goal, the terraforming is complete, and the game ends after that generation.

1007;9474;169255;"In A Game of Thrones: The Card Game, the warring factions of Westeros await your command, inviting you to engage in a life-or-death struggle. In every game, you select devious plots and challenge your opponents on the field of battle, through back alley intrigue, and in the political arena. Whether you play a against a single opponent, in a game known as a joust, or engage in a battle of three or more players, called a melee, winning challenges against your opponents is the way to victory.&#10;&#10;Your ultimate goal in A Game of Thrones: The Card Game is to gain influence over the greatest seat of power in Westeros: the Iron Throne! To achieve this goal, you must call upon iconic characters, such as Tywin Lannister, Robb Stark, Stannis Baratheon, Daenerys Targaryen, Euron Crow's Eye, The Red Viper, and dozens of others. You must maneuver the members of your House and your allies in a constant battle to gain power. The first player to claim fifteen power wins!&#10;&#10;In the game, each player has two decks: a draw deck and a plot deck. Your draw deck contains the tactical elements of your struggle, including the characters, locations, attachments, and events that you call upon in your struggle to claim the Iron Throne. You can command characters from throughout A Song of Ice and Fire, and you can march forth from the icy walls of Winterfell or muster your armies around Casterly Rock. You may even equip your characters with storied weapons, such as the Valyrian steel blades Ice or Widow's Wail. The draw deck holds these powerful characters, locations, attachments, and events. This deck is randomly shuffled and players draw their hands from this deck.&#10;&#10;At the start of each round, each player simultaneously chooses and reveals one of the plot cards from their individual seven-card plot decks. Your plot for a round determines how much gold you can spend on cards, which player starts with initiative, and how powerful your challenges are. Your plot also bears a reserve value, which determines how many cards you can keep in your hand past the end of the round. Plots may also offer powerful effects that can trigger when the plots are revealed or persist to shape the entire game round. You may scorch the earth with a deadly wildfire assault, or call upon all players to support the faith of the Seven.&#10;&#10;A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition) differs from the first edition of the game due to elements being cut, elements being revised or updated, and elements being added. Influence was a holdover from the game's origin as a CCG and is now unnecessary, while crests offered nothing to distinguish them from traits and made the game more difficult for new players to learn. Existing keywords have been pruned, and some new keywords have been added to showcase the most interesting and essential interactions.&#10;&#10;The timing rules &mdash; such as the details of moribund, passive effects with triggers, and save/cancel responses &mdash; will be replaced with a more straightforward timing system that takes advantage of the Interrupt, Reaction, and Forced triggers that have been successfully employed in some of FFG's newer LCGs.&#10;&#10;The second edition also includes two new factions beyond the six Houses in the first edition. New deck-building rules empower players with more options in combining factions, alongside a means of building more focused and specialized plot decks.&#10;&#10;";4;120;14;2;60;A Game of Thrones: The Card Game (Second Edition);120;2015;;Card Game,Collectible Components,Fantasy,Fighting,Medieval,Negotiation,Novel-based;Nate French,Eric M.

1014;9497;169786;"It is a time of unrest in 1920s Europa. The ashes from the first great war still darken the snow. The capitalistic city-state known simply as &ldquo;The Factory&rdquo;, which fueled the war with heavily armored mechs, has closed its doors, drawing the attention of several nearby countries.&#10;&#10;Scythe is an engine-building game set in an alternate-history 1920s period. It is a time of farming and war, broken hearts and rusted gears, innovation and valor. In Scythe, each player represents a character from one of five factions of Eastern Europa who are attempting to earn their fortune and claim their faction's stake in the land around the mysterious Factory. Players conquer territory, enlist new recruits, reap resources, gain villagers, build structures, and activate monstrous mechs.&#10;&#10;Each player begins the game with different resources (power, coins, combat acumen, and popularity), a different starting location, and a hidden goal. Starting positions are specially calibrated to contribute to each faction&rsquo;s uniqueness and the asymmetrical nature of the game (each faction always starts in the same place).&#10;&#10;Scythe gives players almost complete control over their fate. Other than each player&rsquo;s individual hidden objective card, the only elements of luck or variability are &ldquo;encounter&rdquo; cards that players will draw as they interact with the citizens of newly explored lands. Each encounter card provides the player with several options, allowing them to mitigate the luck of the draw through their selection. Combat is also driven by choices, not luck or randomness.&#10;&#10;Scythe uses a streamlined action-selection mechanism (no rounds or phases) to keep gameplay moving at a brisk pace and reduce downtime between turns. While there is plenty of direct conflict for players who seek it, there is no player elimination.&#10;&#10;Every part of Scythe has an aspect of engine-building to it. Players can upgrade actions to become more efficient, build structures that improve their position on the map, enlist new recruits to enhance character abilities, activate mechs to deter opponents from invading, and expand their borders to reap greater types and quantities of resources. These engine-building aspects create a sense of momentum and progress throughout the game. The order in which players improve their engine adds to the unique feel of each game, even when playing one faction multiple times.&#10;&#10;";5;115;14;1;90;Scythe;115;2016;Jakub Rozalski;Civilization,Economic,Fighting,Science Fiction,Territory Building;Jamey Stegmaier;Alternate History,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Scythe,Solitaire Games,Tableau Building;Area Control / Area Influence,Grid Movement,Variable Player Powers;Stonemaier Games,Albi,Crowd Games,Delta Vision Publishing,Feuerland Spiele,Fire on Board Jogos,Ghenos Games,Maldito Games,Matagot,Morning,PHALANX,Playfun Games;8.33346;14817;scythe;0;3.117647058823529;3.2352941176470584;4.223331005586593;0;0.39;yqR4PtpO8X;False;10;5.0;120.0;14.0;1.0;90.0;Scythe;716;1-5;5228;90-120;54.92;99.95;77.95;53.28;16803;2016.0;scythe

So gather your warriors, it&rsquo;s raiding season!&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Aim of the Game&#10;&#10;The aim of Raiders of the North Sea is to impress the Chieftain by having the most Victory Points (VP) at the game&rsquo;s end. Victory Points are gained primarily by raiding Settlements, taking Plunder and making Offerings to the Chieftain. How players use their Plunder is also vital to their success. The game ends when either only 1 Fortress raid remains, all Valkyrie are removed, or all Offerings have been made.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;Gameplay Overview&#10;&#10;Proceeding clockwise from the starting player, each player takes his turn in full. On his turn, a player may choose to Work or Raid. Players continue to take turns until 1 of the 3 end-game conditions has been met. Regardless of choices, each turn follows the same pattern:&#10;&#10;1. Place Worker and resolve its action&#10;2. Pick up a different Worker and resolve its action&#10;&#10;Working&#10;Having a good Crew and enough provisions are vital to successful raiding. So before making any raids, players will need to do some work to prepare their Crew and collect supplies. This is all done in the Village, at the bottom of the board. There are 8 different buildings, with various actions. Players must first place their one and only Worker in an available building (where there is no Worker present), before picking up a different Worker from a different building (where there is a Worker present).&#10;&#10;Raiding&#10;Once players have hired enough Crew and collected Provisions, they may choose to raid on their turn.

Enough Provisions (and Gold for Monasteries/Fortresses).&#10;3. The required Worker colour.&#10;&#10;Raiding offers various ways of scoring (Military Strength, Plunder, Valkyrie, etc.). This is also how Grey and White Workers enter the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#10;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;&#9;End of the Game&#10;&#10;There are 3 ways the game can end:&#10;&#10;1.

These &ldquo;Gods&rsquo; Gifts&rdquo; grant you numerous boons for your clan including: increased Viking strength and devious battle strategies, upgrades to your clan, or even the aid of legendary creatures from Norse mythology. They may also include various quests, from dominating specific provinces, to having lots of your Vikings sent to Valhalla. Most of these cards are aligned with one of the Norse gods, hinting at the kind of strategy they support. For example, Thor gives more glory for victory in battle, Heimdall grants you foresight and surprises, Tyr strengthens you in battle, while the trickster Loki actually rewards you for losing battles, or punishes the winner.&#10;&#10;Players must choose their strategies carefully during the draft phase, but also be ready to adapt and react to their opponents&rsquo; strategies as the action phase unfolds. Battles are decided not only by the strength of the figures involved, but also by cards played in secret. By observing your opponent&rsquo;s actions and allegiances to specific gods, you may predict what card they are likely to play, and plan accordingly. Winning battles is not always the best course of action, as the right card can get you even more rewards by being crushed. The only losing strategy in Blood Rage is to shy away from battle and a glorious death!&#10;&#10;";4;90;14;2;60;Blood Rage;90;2015;Henning Ludvigsen,Mike McVey,Adrian Smith;Fantasy,Fighting,Miniatures,Mythology;Eric M.

Be organized and communicate because a captain is nothing without his crew: the Chief Mate, the Radio Operator, and the Engineer.&#10;&#10;All the members of a team sit on one side of the table, and they each take a particular role on the submarine, with the division of labor for these roles being dependent on the number of players in the game: One player might be the captain, who is responsible for moving the submarine and announcing some details of this movement; another player is manning the sonar in order to listen to the opposing captain's orders and try to decipher where that sub might be in the water; a third player might be working in the munitions room to prepare torpedoes, mines and other devices that will allow for combat.&#10;&#10;Captain Sonar can be played in two modes: turn-by-turn or simultaneous.

They taught you to light a flickering flame at the tip of your finger, but other than that you've spent much more time reading books than learning powerful spells as future great wizards like you should.&#10;&#10;So when you heard about the Big Book of Madness hidden in the great school library, you couldn't help but to sneak in and peek in this intriguing tome in spite of your professors' warnings.

Spells allow you to support your playmates, improve your deck, draw cards, etc. &mdash; but the monsters from the book fight back. Each comes with terrible curses that are triggered every turn unless you dispel them in time.

1026;9546;171261;"For those with the eldritch gift, temptation lurks around every corner, even in leisure. Just consider the possibilities available to the practitioner of magic. Imagine poker with spells! No person could resist such temptation, and even a casual review of history will prove that none could.&#10;&#10;&#10;    The famous last play of Ephippus of Athens? It was about Circe&rsquo;s never ending thirst for cheating at cards. &#10;    Morgan le Fay and Merlin regularly crossed wits over a deck. &#10;    Roger Bollingbroke&rsquo;s most heinous crime was the transparently bogus run of five straight flushes in a row. &#10;&#10;&#10;And so it has gone. The application of magic to card games is as natural as mixing mandrake and worm&rsquo;s husk.&#10;&#10;For the first time, however, the rules for a game specifically created for wizards have been pieced together from fragments found in tombs, dusty used bookstores, and in the classified ads of one small newspaper. Though magic has largely been forgotten in the centuries since this game was invented, modern game design has given us a way to imitate the arcana outlined in the reconstructed rules. The result is a &ldquo;no-magic-required&rdquo; whimsical romp for 2-5 players.&#10;&#10;Hocus places the players in the flamboyant boots of wizards, using their powerful advantages to create opportunities, manipulate the game, and alter the flow of cards. Wizards hate being pinned down and live by the mantra &ldquo;You shall not fold!&rdquo; Each turn, players choose one Spell to use. As you are new to Hocus, we shall first discuss the three Basic Spells.&#10;&#10;Use the first basic Spell to play cards to the Community. Play thoughtfully, as everyone shares the cards in the Community! The second Spell is for building the Pot. In addition to Suit and Strength, every card has a point value. Cards played to the Pot contribute their points to the winner of each Showdown. Play cards to build a Pocket with the third Spell. (Never ask to see a wizard&rsquo;s pocket!) Each player takes one of their Pockets and combines it with the Community to form a hand during Showdowns. The best hand claims all points in the Pot.&#10;&#10;There is, of course, a twist. Trust a wizard to provide a twist! There are multiple Communities, each with a Pot, and players can compete in multiple Showdowns if they have the Pockets. Hocus is not merely a matter of building good hands, but making a winning hand where your opponents least expect and profiting with a hefty Pot. Timing and careful, targeted play will win the day. And time is limited. You may have conjured a Straight Flush, but it&rsquo;s worthless with no points in the Pot!&#10;&#10;Now, look at the other spells in the game. There are eight different spell books, each with their own unique approaches to the game, providing every wizard who plays with their own special abilities. The spell books raise the game to another level, with even more tools for bending luck to your advantage.&#10;&#10;Travel way back to a dark, dank inn, shuffle the cards, and play the favorite game of the legendary Merlin and Morgan le Fay. Hocus is a little like poker, but a lot more magic!&#10;&#10;";5;30;10;2;30;Hocus;30;2016;John Ariosa,Adam P.

The playing area starts with only a couple of jungle tiles in play: a cacao field and a small market; two jungle tiles are laid face up, and the remaining jungle tiles stacked as a draw pile.&#10;&#10;On a player's turn, she places one of her worker tiles on the board adjacent to one or more jungle tiles already in play, then (if two worker tiles are next to an empty space) adds one of the jungle tiles to the playing area in this space.

She then refills her hand from her personal deck to three worker tiles.&#10;&#10;Once all players have used all of their worker tiles, the game ends.

1029;9564;171623;"In 1271, 17-year-old Marco Polo started on a journey to China with his father and older brother. After a long and grueling journey that led through Jerusalem and Mesopotamia and over the &quot;Silk Road&quot;, they reached the court of Kublai Khan in 1275.&#10;&#10;In The Voyages of Marco Polo, players recreate this journey, with each player having a different character and special power in the game. The game is played over five rounds. Each round, the players roll their five personal dice and can perform one action each turn with them. The five main actions are shown on the bottom part of the board:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Get resources with 1-3 dice, depending on the value of the resource (camels, pepper, silk, gold). The first player for each resource gets them for free; the later ones have to pay according to the value shown on the dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Take one resource of your choice and two camels. Each player sets the minimum value for the future dice.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Earn money, with any one die netting you five money.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Purchase orders: The value of one die unlocks the orders up to that number (shown on the spaces) and allows you to buy one or two of those orders. Orders are refreshed and placed at the beginning of each round. To fulfill an order, players have to spend resources for victory points, other resources, camels, and more.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;    Travel: Two dice are placed to unlock the distance that can be traveled on the upper part of the board, that is, the map. Here, the traveler piece of each player starts at Venice and can decide between several routes eastward, all the way to Beijing. When a traveler stops at a city, they place a marker there, giving them access to a different additional action for the rest of the game.&#10;&#10;&#10;After five rounds, the game ends with players receiving victory points for arriving in Beijing, fulfilling the most orders, and having reached the cities on secret city cards that each player gets at the start of the game; these points are added to the VPs gained during the game.&#10;&#10;Auf den Spuren von Marco Polo should not be confused with Marco Polo Expedition, which had the same German title.&#10;&#10;";4;100;12;2;40;The Voyages of Marco Polo;100;2015;Dennis Lohausen;Dice,Economic,Medieval,Travel;Simone Luciani,Daniele Tascini;Animals: Camels,Cities: Beijing,Cities: Hormuz,Cities: Venice;Card Drafting,Dice Rolling,Point to Point Movement,Set Collection,Variable Player Powers,Worker Placement;Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH,999 Games,Albi,Arclight,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Giochi Uniti,Swan Panasia Co., Ltd.,Z-Man Games;7.98521;9027;the voyages of marco polo;5;3.5;4.0;3.9200871029131896;0;0.2;jBBIIYQmED;False;0;4.0;90.0;12.0;2.0;45.0;The Voyages of Marco Polo;253;2-4;1680;45-90;47.99;81.99;46.97;0.0;2079;2015.0;the voyages of marco polo

While making the trek from Mannheim to Pforzheim, her car ran out of fuel in Wiesloch. Mrs. Benz stopped into the city drugstore to obtain the appropriate chemicals to make more fuel, effectively creating the world&acute;s first gas station.&#10;&#10;By the year 1928, Germany possessed a dense road network where combustion engines had triumphed over electric and steam engines and where cars were produced via assembly lines.

1034;9579;171908;"In El Grande, players take on the roles of Grandes in medieval Spain. The king's power is flagging, and these powerful lords are vying for control of the various regions. To that end, you draft caballeros (knights in the form of meeples) into your court and subsequently move them onto the board to help seize control of regions. After every third round, the regions are scored, and after the ninth round, the player with the most points is the winner.&#10;&#10;In each of the nine rounds, you select one of your 13 power cards to determine turn order as well as the number of caballeros you get to move from the provinces (general supply) into your court (personal supply).&#10;&#10;A turn then consists of selecting one of five action cards which allow variations to the rules and additional scoring opportunities in addition to determining how many caballeros to move from your court to one or more of the regions on the board (or into the castillo&mdash;a secretive tower). Normally, you may only place your caballeros into regions adjacent to the one containing the king's pawn. The one hard and fast rule in El Grande is that nothing may move into or out of the king's region. One of the five action cards that is always available each round allows you to move the king to a new region. The other four action cards vary from round to round.&#10;&#10;The goal is to have a majority of caballeros in as many regions (and the castillo) as possible during a scoring round. Following the scoring of the castillo, you place any meeples you had stashed there into the region you had secretly indicated on your region dial. Each region is then scored individually according to a table printed in that region. Two-point bonuses are awarded for having sole majority in the region containing your Grande (large meeple) and in the region containing the king.&#10;&#10;El Grande Big Box, the 20th anniversary edition of El Grande, includes all previously published expansions: Grand Inquisitor &amp; Colonies, Grandissimo, King &amp; Intrigant, King &amp; Intrigant: Players' Edition and King &amp; Intrigant: Special Cards as well as something currently known only as the &quot;Anniversary Extension&quot;.&#10;&#10;";5;90;12;2;90;El Grande Big Box;90;2015;Doris Matthäus;Renaissance;Wolfgang Kramer,Richard Ulrich;Country: Spain,El Grande;Area Control / Area Influence,Area Movement,Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Hand Management,Memory,Simultaneous Action Selection;Hans im Glück Verlags-GmbH,999 Games,Devir,Filosofia Éditions,Giochi Uniti,Z-Man Games;8.36868;986;el grande big box;9;0.0;0.0;4.074302325581396;0;0.0;ot8xOw2sdr;False;0;5.0;120.0;12.0;2.0;90.0;El Grande Big Box;43;2-5;138;90-120;0.0;138.09;0.0;73.95;1682;2015.0;el grande big box

The Dragonwood deck has 42 cards, 5 of which are displayed in the landscape at any time.  In addition to creatures, this deck also has enhancements that are captured in the same way as creatures which assist players in capturing creatures, and contains events that also impact play.  When both dragons have been defeated, the game is over and the player with the most victory points wins!&#10;  &#10;Is the best strategy to go for several smaller creatures or save up for larger attacks?  Should you grab some enhancements hoping they will pay off, or go immediately for creatures?  Do you take chances on some rolls or go for sure things?

On a turn, a player must discard at least two cards from hand onto one or more discard piles, with cards on the 1 piles being placed in ascending order and cards on the 100 piles being placed in descending order. One tricky aspect to play is that you can play a card exactly 10 higher/lower than the top card of a discard pile even when you would normally have to play in a descending/ascending order, e.g., if a 100 discard pile is topped with an 87, you can play any card lower than 87 or you can play the 97.&#10;&#10;After a player finishes their turn, they refill their hand from the deck. During play, players cannot reveal exact numbers in their hands, but they can warn others not to play on certain discard piles or otherwise make play suggestions.&#10;&#10;Once the deck is emptied, players are required only to play at least one card on a turn.

The battles, included in the scenario booklet, focus on the historical deployment of forces and important terrain features of trench fighting in scale with the game system. The scale of the game is flexible and varies from battle to battle. For some scenarios, a few infantry units may represent an entire wing of a larger battle, while in other scenarios a unit may represent just a few brave soldiers going over the top.&#10;&#10;The Command card system drives movement, creates a &quot;fog of war&quot;, and presents players with many interesting opportunities, while the battle dice resolve combat quickly and efficiently. The Combat cards add an element of suspense and will challenge players to coordinate their use in a timely manner. Overall, the battlefield tactics players will need to execute to gain victory conform remarkably well to the strengths and limitations of the various types of WWI units, their weapons, battlefield terrain, and written history.&#10;&#10;In this core game, the main focus is on a number of WWI trench warfare battles.

A player can take a card only if it's not covered by any others, so timing comes into play as well as bonus moves that allow you to take a second card immediately. As in the original game, each card that you acquire can be built, discarded for coins, or used to construct a wonder.&#10;&#10;Each player starts with four wonder cards, and the construction of a wonder provides its owner with a special ability. Only seven wonders can be built, though, so one player will end up short.&#10;&#10;Players can purchase resources at any time from the bank, or they can gain cards during the game that provide them with resources for future building; as you acquire resources, the cost for those particular resources increases for your opponent, representing your dominance in this area.&#10;&#10;A player can win 7 Wonders Duel in one of three ways: each time you acquire a military card, you advance the military marker toward your opponent's capital, giving you a bonus at certain positions; if you reach the opponent's capital, you win the game immediately; similarly, if you acquire any six of seven different scientific symbols, you achieve scientific dominance and win immediately; if none of these situations occurs, then the player with the most points at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;";2;30;10;2;30;7 Wonders Duel;30;2015;Miguel Coimbra;Ancient,Card Game,City Building,Civilization;Antoine Bauza,Bruno Cathala;7 Wonders,7 Wonders Duel,Tableau Building;Card Drafting,Set Collection;Repos Production,ADC Blackfire Entertainment,Asterion Press,Galápagos Jogos,Gém Klub Kft.,Kaissa Chess & Games,Lautapelit.fi,Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd,Ludicus,REBEL.pl;8.1939;20088;7 wonders duel;0;2.4444444444444446;2.6666666666666665;4.060704647676161;0;0.2;j8LdPFmePE;False;0;2.0;45.0;10.0;2.0;30.0;7 Wonders Duel;667;2;6798;30-45;27.99;43.95;17.49;18.39;6163;2015.0;7 wonders duel

In addition to a one-of-a-kind theme, there are five core elements that make Swamped incredibly fun and a surprisingly unique gaming experience:&#10;&#10;1. Player-shared pieces: All players share ownership of the same tiny boat in the swamp, so the actions of any one player impact every other player directly.&#10;&#10;2. Secret and shared objectives: Everyone knows the main objective, but each player also has a hidden goal that might lead the whole expedition into deadly peril!&#10;&#10;3. Player controlled game-length: Players can speed-up or slow-down the game down depending on their preference. Some will try to get out of the swamp quickly, while others will delay until they've collected precisely the right combination of treasures.&#10;&#10;4. Surprise ending: It is unlikely that anyone can know with 100% certainty who has won the game before each player's secret objective is revealed, leading to an exciting reveal at the very end!&#10;&#10;5. Efficient use of physical components: Despite its small size (35 cards and two pieces), most cards have multiple uses and orientations leading to a surprisingly deep set of decisions each player can make.

1061;9724;175155;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The shifting Warp Storms that surround the long lost Herakon Cluster have finally abated, leaving the ancient treasures and planets within this sector open to the rest of the galaxy. Now, the great factions of the galaxy mobilize their fleets and race to establish a foothold. The reward for successful domination surpasses all other concerns, and the price for conquering this sector will be paid in lives.&#10;&#10;Forbidden Stars challenges you and up to three other players to take command of a mighty fighting force: the Ultramarines chapter of Space Marines, the Eldar of Craftworld Iyanden, the Evil Sunz Ork clan, or the World Eaters Warband of the Chaos Space Marines. Each faction offers unique armies and play styles, but your goal remains the same &ndash; to claim the key objectives selected for your faction. These objective tokens are scattered throughout the Herakon Cluster, but your opponents are sure to defend your objectives against you. You need to build massive armies and command them in unending war to best your enemies and claim your objectives. The fight for the Herakon Cluster is brutal and bloody, and you will either stride triumphant over the bodies of your fallen foes, or they will do the same to you.&#10;&#10;Gameplay:&#10;&#10;Each round in Forbidden Stars is divided into three phases.  In the Planning Phase, players will take turns placing order tokens face down on the separate tiles (systems) that make up the game board.  The four types of order tokens that players may place during the Planning Phase correspond to four types of actions that players can resolve in the second phase of play, Operations.  In the Operations Phase, players can reveal a Dominate token to drain friendly planets of their important resources, a Strategize token to purchase cards that can upgrade their orders and combat abilities, a Deploy order that allows them to build cities, factories, bastions, and new mobile units, or an Advance order to move units and attack their enemies.  The last phase of each round is the Refresh Phase, where players profit from the planets they control, reveal event cards to move the impassable Warp Storms, and heal any units that were wounded in battle.&#10;&#10;Because of the game's three-phase structure, strategy in Forbidden Stars is balanced between short-term bluffing and long-term tactical military action.  The game's setup also poses strategic opportunities.  Players start the game by taking turns assembling sections of the Herakon Cluster, placing individual system tiles along with their own starting forces and the enemy objectives that they must defend.  This intentional construction, along with the unique Domination abilities of the game's four factions, means that Forbidden Stars will see players working to best utilize their own force's strengths while exploiting the weaknesses of their opponents.&#10;&#10;";4;180;14;2;120;Forbidden Stars;180;2015;;Bluffing,Dice,Fighting,Miniatures,Science Fiction,Wargame;Samuel Bailey,James Kniffen,Corey Konieczka;Components: Miniatures,Fantasy Flight Big Box,Warhammer 40,000 Board Games;Area Control / Area Influence,Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Modular Board,Variable Player Powers;Asterion Press,Edge Entertainment,Fantasy Flight Games,Galakta,Heidelberger Spieleverlag;8.06745;3764;forbidden stars;41;0.0;0.0;3.547894736842105;0;-1.94;hR5nHkCzr5;False;0;4.0;180.0;14.0;2.0;120.0;Forbidden Stars;76;2-4;175;120-180;249.95;0.0;0.0;0.0;1845;2015.0;forbidden stars

Fortunately, automated probes sent to Mars have discovered celerium, an ore that can be combusted to produce ten thousand times more power than a steam engine, and sylvanite, the densest substance ever found. More incredibly, the probes found ice that could be used in terraforming the planet, bringing the idea of colonizing Mars even closer to becoming a reality.&#10;&#10;As the head of a mining corporation, these minerals and ice found on Mars could make you unfathomably wealthy &ndash; if you can reach them before your competitors. You have ten rounds to send your astronauts into space, occupy the planet's most resource-rich zones, and harvest as much celerium, sylvanite, and ice as possible. At your command is a team of nine professionals. Each has a unique skill set, from helping your astronauts traverse the Red Planet to blowing up spaceships before they launch.&#10;&#10;In each round in Mission: Red Planet, players start by secretly deploying one of their character cards, with this card determining both when they place astronauts on the spaceships awaiting launch to Mars and which special action they take during the round. Each spaceship has a specified destination, and until an astronaut sets foot in a region, no one knows which resource they'll find. Players collect resources (worth points) three times during the game, and they each have a secret mission card that might grant them additional points at game's end. During the game, players might acquire an additional mission or a research card that changes the value of what awaits on Mars.&#10;&#10;The 2015 edition of Mission: Red Planet features the same gameplay as the original 2005 edition, but it includes:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Components for up to six players instead of five&#10;    Special two-player variant rules&#10;    New action cards and revised mission and discovery cards&#10;    Mars' moon Phobos as a new zone that astronauts can explore before possibly returning to the planet itself&#10;&#10;&#10;";6;90;14;2;45;Mission: Red Planet (Second Edition);90;2015;Andrew Bosley,Samuel Shimota;Science Fiction;Bruno Cathala,Bruno Faidutti;Mars,Steampunk;Area Control / Area Influence,Hand Management,Simultaneous Action Selection;Edge Entertainment,Fantasy Flight Games,Galakta,Giochi Uniti,Heidelberger Spieleverlag;7.66423;4108;mission: red planet (second edition);4;3.0;3.0;3.6355191082802545;0;0.2;H6O51FVWf5;False;0;6.0;90.0;14.0;2.0;45.0;Mission: Red Planet (Second Edition);157;2-6;412;45-90;39.95;77.99;52.69;0.0;2015;2015.0;mission: red planet (second edition)

1091;9890;179719;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Risk: Game of Thrones, based on the epic HBO series, features two ways to play, including factions of noble Houses vying for control of Westeros during the time of The War of the Five Kings, as well as Daenerys Targaryen's rise to power in Essos.&#10;&#10;War and chaos have descended upon the realms of Men. In Westeros, the death of Robert Baratheon has created a power vacuum with rival Houses competing for control of The Iron Throne. Meanwhile, in Essos, Daenerys Targaryen is building an army to contest the rule of the Ghiscari slavers, before returning to reclaim The Iron Throne. There are 3 different ways to play RISK Game of Thrones:&#10;&#10;1. SKIRMISH&#10;Basic version designed as an introduction to RISK Game of Thrones game play. Once you are comfortable, move on to Dominion.&#10;&#10;2. DOMINION&#10;Advanced version of RISK Game of Thrones including Objectives, Characters, and Maester cards, offering more in-depth strategic action.&#10;&#10;3. WORLD AT WAR&#10;Play with both maps and up to seven players using either the Skirmish or Dominion rules.&#10;&#10;RISK Game of Thrones includes two game board maps and seven House armies. Westeros map is for 3-5 player game and Essos map is for 2 player game. There is a deck of territory cards for each map, and these function in a similar way to the original RISK gameplay. When playing Dominion rules, the character cards can grant special abilities to your House, the maester cards can grant tactical advantages during deployment and battles, and objective cards create goals and strategies for earning Victory Points.&#10;&#10;Skirmish rules are most similar to the original RISK rules. There are minor thematic variations to suit the new map. The winner is determined by which player controls the most territories, castles and ports when the end game card is revealed.&#10;&#10;Dominion rules add the additional mechanics and cards described above. Instead of simply trying to control the most territories, castles, and ports you are now trying to achieve specific Objectives to earn Victory Points, furthering your efforts to consolidate power and establish dominion over the rival Houses. Objectives are worth from 1 to 4 Victory Points, based on the difficulty to achieve them. The first player to earn 10 Victory Points while also controlling their Seat of Power wins the game.&#10;&#10;";7;240;18;2;120;Risk: Game of Thrones;240;2015;;Movies / TV / Radio theme,Wargame;Andrew Wolf;Admin: Better Description Needed!,Risk,A Song of Ice and Fire;Area Control / Area Influence,Dice Rolling,Player Elimination;USAopoly,Winning Eleven Productions,Winning Moves Germany;7.0865800000000005;308;risk: game of thrones;61;0.0;0.0;2.895833333333333;0;0.2;yZiA3jaqrs;False;0;7.0;240.0;18.0;2.0;120.0;Risk: Game of Thrones;12;2-7;19;120-240;59.99;69.95;79.95;0.0;504;2015.0;risk: game of thrones

1093;9905;180198;"Rolling America, based on the 2014 release Rolling Japan, is a light &quot;multiplayer solitaire&quot; dice game. Each player has a map of the United States that's divided into fifty (abstractly represented) states, which are then bunched together into six differently colored areas.&#10;&#10;On a turn, a player draws two regular six-sided dice from a bag and rolls them; the bag starts with seven dice, six matching the colors of the areas on the map along with a wild clear die. All players now write down each number rolled on any state of the matching color, i.e., if the blue die shows 4 and the yellow a 2, write a 4 in one blue state and a 2 in one yellow state. If the clear die is rolled, you can place this number in a state of your choice; additionally, three times per game you can choose to use a non-clear die as any color. However, neighboring states can't have numbers with a difference larger than 1; if you can't place a number without breaking this rule, then you must place an X in a state of the appropriate color. (If all the states in an area are filled, you can ignore the die or use one of your three color changes to place the number elsewhere.)&#10;&#10;Rolling America has a few changes from Rolling Japan. The &quot;guard&quot; action allows you to ignore the neighboring number restriction three times during the game, and the &quot;dupe&quot; action allows you to use one of the active dice twice in the same region. As in real life, Alaska and Hawaii are not connected to the continental United States, so you can drop any numbers you want in those states!&#10;&#10;After six dice have been rolled, mark one round as being complete, then return the dice to the bag and start the next round.

1094;9917;180471;"Can you gather and secure more treasure than your fellow-adventurers from the Hoard of the sleeping dragon? Can you defend yourself from their attacks and perhaps perpetrate a few of your own? And can you end the hunt at the most opportune time, perhaps by actually wakening the fearsome beast?&#10;&#10;Hoard is a dynamic game of hand management, set collection, and press-your-luck. Each turn players take one of four possible actions:  1) roll a custom die and move to take a new card, 2) secure a set of treasures or add to an existing set to score points, 3) affect the dragon, who wakes in stages from his tail to his head, by playing cards that soothe or rouse him, or 4) use a sword on an opponent or capture a used sword with a shield. The board is composed of 12 facedown cards surrounding the dragon.  It changes as players remove and replace the cards. Dice rolls between 1-5 enable clockwise or counterclockwise movement and the special symbol allows access to all but one of the cards, so it is a game that rewards memory.&#10;&#10;Hoard is meant to be played in rounds, with scoring tokens obviating the need for pencil and paper scorekeeping.&#10;&#10;A limited run of Hoard was self-published by Tim Kings-Lynne and Beck Veitch in 2014. They entered into an agreement with Cheeky Parrot Games in order to improve the game play and get Hoard re-published and more widely distributed. Hoard was successfully funded on Kickstarter in mid-2016. The Kickstarted version with deluxe features released into the New Zealand and Australian markets in Q4 2016.

To win, you have to gamble your relationships with the most powerful bosses in town to win influence. This influence comes in many forms: Law, Money and Force. If you&rsquo;re clever enough, you&rsquo;ll be able to take claim over the buildings in the evergrowing boomtowns and gain powerful abilities. At the end of the day, the boss who has the best combination of wit and bluff will become the most powerful tycoon in the Wild Wild West.&#10;&#10;GAMEPLAY: The game is played in a series of rounds.  Each round, poker cards are dealt between the locations, which are laid out in a circle.  Players place posse members on these location cards, which will both give an action and count as a bid for the location's valuable resources.  Players also get a poker card of their own which uses the two adjacent cards from a location to form a three-card hand.  This creates a clever mix of modern worker placement and poker that drives the game. In addition, players must manage their resources of Law, Money and Force to buy buildings and gunfight. If you have the highest stake in the most lucrative industry at the end, you will be rewarded bonus points.

1102;9966;181304;"In the 1920s, Mr. MacDowell, a gifted astrologist, immediately detected a supernatural being upon entering his new house in Scotland. He gathered eminent mediums of his time for an extraordinary s&eacute;ance, and they have seven hours to contact the ghost and investigate any clues that it can provide to unlock an old mystery.&#10;&#10;Unable to talk, the amnesic ghost communicates with the mediums through visions, which are represented in the game by illustrated cards. The mediums must decipher the images to help the ghost remember how he was murdered: Who did the crime? Where did it take place? Which weapon caused the death? The more the mediums cooperate and guess well, the easier it is to catch the right culprit.&#10;&#10;In Mysterium, a reworking of the game system present in Tajemnicze Domostwo, one player takes the role of ghost while everyone else represents a medium. To solve the crime, the ghost must first recall (with the aid of the mediums) all of the suspects present on the night of the murder. A number of suspect, location and murder weapon cards are placed on the table, and the ghost randomly assigns one of each of these in secret to a medium.&#10;&#10;Each hour (i.e., game turn), the ghost hands one or more vision cards face up to each medium, refilling their hand to seven each time they share vision cards. These vision cards present dreamlike images to the mediums, with each medium first needing to deduce which suspect corresponds to the vision cards received. Once the ghost has handed cards to the final medium, they start a two-minute sandtimer. Once a medium has placed their token on a suspect, they may also place clairvoyancy tokens on the guesses made by other mediums to show whether they agree or disagree with those guesses.&#10;&#10;After time runs out, the ghost reveals to each medium whether the guesses were correct or not. Mediums who guessed correctly move on to guess the location of the crime (and then the murder weapon), while those who didn't keep their vision cards and receive new ones next hour corresponding to the same suspect. Once a medium has correctly guessed the suspect, location and weapon, they move their token to the epilogue board and receive one clairvoyancy point for each hour remaining on the clock. They can still use their remaining clairvoyancy tokens to score additional points.&#10;&#10;If one or more mediums fail to identify their proper suspect, location and weapon before the end of the seventh hour, then the ghost has failed and dissipates, leaving the mystery unsolved. If, however, they have all succeeded, then the ghost has recovered enough of its memory to identify the culprit.&#10;&#10;Mediums then group their suspect, location and weapon cards on the table and place a number by each group.

Each player attempts to build the best civilization through careful resource management, discovering new technologies, electing the right leaders, building wonders and maintaining a strong military. Weakness in any area can be exploited by your opponents. The game takes place throughout the ages beginning in the age of antiquity and ending in the modern age.&#10;&#10;One of the primary mechanisms in TTA is card drafting. Technologies, wonders, and leaders come into play and become easier to draft the longer they are in play. In order to use a technology you will need enough science to discover it, enough food to create a population to man it and enough resources (ore) to build the building to use it. While balancing the resources needed to advance your technology you also need to build a military. Military is built in the same way as civilian buildings. Players that have a weak military will be preyed upon by other players. There is no map in the game so you cannot lose territory, but players with higher military will steal resources, science, kill leaders, take population or culture. It is very difficult to win with a large military, but it is very easy to lose because of a weak one.&#10;&#10;Victory is achieved by the player whose nation has the most culture at the end of the modern age.&#10;&#10;";4;240;14;2;180;Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization;240;2015;Jakub Politzer,Milan Vavroň;Card Game,Civilization,Economic;Vlaada Chvátil;Tableau Building;Action Point Allowance System,Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Hand Management;Cranio Creations,Czech Games Edition,Devir,DiceTree Games,Eagle-Gryphon Games,Gém Klub Kft.,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,IELLO,MINDOK,One Moment Games,REBEL.pl;8.74235;6888;through the ages: a new story of civilization;30;4.0;4.25;3.981558557552752;0;0.64;k4sSktfbuH;False;66;4.0;240.0;14.0;2.0;120.0;Through the Ages: A New Story of Civilization;212;2-4;1518;120-240;24.95;66.45;16.99;39.99;3040;2015.0;through the ages: a new story of civilization

You'll need to pick a board, paddle out, look for waves, and ride them in to score points!&#10;&#10;Tavarua is played over a number of short rounds. In each round waves advance towards shore, players simultaneously select then resolve actions by playing cards, and a wave card is revealed and resolved. Rounds continue until there are no more wave cards in the wave deck, at which point the game ends and one player claims victory.&#10;&#10;Goal&#10;The goal of the game is to win the grand champion trophy, by having the highest scoring waves. You score points by catching and riding waves, but you may only keep your top two wave scores for each board type. General gameplay involves looking for a wave to ride, paddling to the wave, catching the wave, riding the wave, then scoring the wave. When the game ends, three trophies are given out, whoever gets the Grand Champion trophy wins!&#10;&#10;Looking For a Wave&#10;At the start of each round all the wave tiles advance one space towards the shore. When looking for a wave to catch, you&rsquo;ll need to remember that you can only catch a broken wave. Waves are either unbroken, or broken. Waves with a die number less than their space in the break are unbroken. Waves with a die number equal to or higher than their space in the break are broken.&#10;&#10;Paddling to a Wave&#10;Paddling moves your surfer in the channel. You can play any card to paddle, the number on the card determines how many spaces you move.&#10;&#10;Catching a Wave&#10;You can only catch the wave that&rsquo;s in the same space in the break as your surfer is in the channel. To catch a wave, you&rsquo;ll need to play a card. The number and direction on the card will shift your balance. When catching a wave you&rsquo;ll want to look at the top card of the wave deck to determine which card to play. You want to play a card that will shift your balance so that you do not wipeout during the Wave / Score phase. You now move your surfer/surfboard onto the wave tile (standing your surfer up) and finally move your played card over to your score pile.&#10;&#10;Riding a Wave&#10;Once you&rsquo;ve caught a wave you are considered to be riding it. While riding, your goal is to maintain your balance, while maximizing scored points. Cards you play will both shift your balance, and count as your score for the wave. The higher the number on the card, the more points it&rsquo;s worth, however the more difficult it will be to maintain your balance. After you play and shift your balance, a wave card will be revealed, and it too will shift your balance. Be careful: if your balance token moves one or more spaces off the nose or tail of your surfboard, you&rsquo;ll wipeout!&#10;&#10;Scoring a Wave &#10;When riding a wave: cards played are not discarded, but placed into your score pile.

In Rebellion, you control the entire Galactic Empire or the fledgling Rebel Alliance. You must command starships, account for troop movements, and rally systems to your cause. Given the differences between the Empire and Rebel Alliance, each side has different win conditions, and you'll need to adjust your play style depending on who you represent:&#10;&#10;     As the Imperial player, you can command legions of Stormtroopers, swarms of TIEs, Star Destroyers, and even the Death Star. You rule the galaxy by fear, relying on the power of your massive military to enforce your will. To win the game, you need to snuff out the budding Rebel Alliance by finding its base and obliterating it. Along the way, you can subjugate worlds or even destroy them.&#10;     As the Rebel player, you can command dozens of troopers, T-47 airspeeders, Corellian corvettes, and fighter squadrons. However, these forces are no match for the Imperial military. In terms of raw strength, you'll find yourself clearly overmatched from the very outset, so you'll need to rally the planets to join your cause and execute targeted military strikes to sabotage Imperial build yards and steal valuable intelligence. To win the Galactic Civil War, you'll need to sway the galaxy's citizens to your cause. If you survive long enough and strengthen your reputation, you inspire the galaxy to a full-scale revolt, and you win.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;Featuring more than 150 plastic miniatures and two game boards that account for thirty-two of the Star Wars galaxy's most notable systems, Rebellion features a scope that is as large and sweeping as any Star Wars game before it.&#10;&#10;Yet for all its grandiosity, Rebellion remains intensely personal, cinematic, and heroic. As much as your success depends upon the strength of your starships, vehicles, and troops, it depends upon the individual efforts of such notable characters as Leia Organa, Mon Mothma, Grand Moff Tarkin, and Emperor Palpatine. As civil war spreads throughout the galaxy, these leaders are invaluable to your efforts, and the secret missions they attempt will evoke many of the most inspiring moments from the classic trilogy. You might send Luke Skywalker to receive Jedi training on Dagobah or have Darth Vader spring a trap that freezes Han Solo in carbonite!&#10;&#10;";4;240;14;2;180;Star Wars: Rebellion;240;2016;;Dice,Fighting,Movies / TV / Radio theme,Science Fiction,Wargame;Corey Konieczka;Components: Miniatures,Fantasy Flight Big Box,Star Wars;Area Control / Area Influence,Area Movement,Dice Rolling,Hand Management;ADC Blackfire Entertainment,Asterion Press,Delta Vision Publishing,Edge Entertainment,Fantasy Flight Games,Galakta,Heidelberger Spieleverlag;8.544839999999999;8142;star wars: rebellion;2;3.6666666666666665;3.0;4.17671052631579;0;0.12;Qq2rPNOpoO;False;0;4.0;240.0;14.0;2.0;180.0;Star Wars: Rebellion;228;2-4;616;180-240;87.99;33.99;113.99;79.99;5432;2016.0;star wars: rebellion

The liberal team always has a majority.&#10;&#10;At the beginning of the game, players close their eyes, and the fascists reveal themselves to one another.

The fascists learn who Hitler is, but Hitler doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is.&#10;&#10;Each round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back from the brink of war.&#10;&#10;The objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or assassinate Secret Hitler.

In some rounds, when ships are flying close together, they will also clash in a Boarding action, using the effects of any Pirates they picked up to gain Doubloons and plunder Loot.&#10;&#10;On your turn, take the first of the three shares of Loot on the table, and look at it secretly. You must decide to either take all the cards in the Share then add the top card from the deck face-down to this Loot space, or to leave the Share and look at the next one. If you choose to do the latter, add the top card from the deck to the Share you declined (or a Doubloon, if there's already three cards), thus increasing its value for the next player. If no shares interest you, blindly take the top card of the deck.&#10;&#10;The card backs give you a hint about what&rsquo;s in the next Shares: Pirates to board other ships, legendary Relics to collect, Rum to be scored at the end of the game, and Items with permanent, immediate, or secret effects.&#10;&#10;Every 4 or 5 rounds (depending on the number of players), Boarding action will occur!

Players move with their land sails according to the wind direction: being able to criss-cross slowly upwind or speed in the fastest direction, sailing on a broad reach. Each player can choose which group of raiders to move at the end of their turn until all raiders have moved. This allows players to help each other or force confrontation with the raiders.

Capture highly desired butterflies, put them in your trusty jar, and deliver them to the garden to gain respect from the collecting community and to help diversify the garden &mdash; but watch out for your opponents as lepidopterists can be quite devious!&#10;&#10;The game is played in a series of rounds. Players start each round by playing a card from their hands to determine the round's turn order. Cards are numbered from 0 to 59, and lower numbered cards will go first. On a turn, a player captures butterflies from the field and adds them to the jar (i.e., they take a card from the row of face-up cards and tuck it under their jar card). When possible, players &quot;deliver butterflies&quot; from their jars to the zoo's butterfly garden to score victory points (VPs). Which butterflies can be delivered is indicated on the face-up &quot;delivery cards&quot; and players are often in a race to deliver butterflies to take the cards and score points. The player with the most VPs at the end of the game wins.&#10;&#10;During the game, players must carefully decide which butterfly cards to play. By playing lowered numbered cards, players not only get a better pick of butterflies in the field, but they also get first chance at delivering butterflies. However, lower numbered butterfly cards usually have fewer butterflies on them, so players cannot add as many to their jars. Also, butterfly cards with special powers usually have high numbers, so you often must sacrifice turn order in order to use one of these special powers.&#10;&#10;";6;40;8;2;20;The Butterfly Garden;40;2016;Cathy Gruetzke-Blais;Animals,Card Game;Steve Finn;Animals: Butterflies,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter;Auction/Bidding,Card Drafting,Hand Management,Set Collection,Simultaneous Action Selection;Dr. Finn's Games;6.8963100000000015;194;the butterfly garden;1;0.0;0.0;2.95;0;0.0;Leae8IVPRr;True;0;6.0;40.0;8.0;2.0;20.0;The Butterfly Garden;10;2-6;28;20-40;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;110;2016.0;the butterfly garden

Each minion belongs to one of five aspects of Drow society, and those aspects correspond to different strategies in the game, e.g., malice minions excel at assassinating opponents' troops, while ambition minions are best at recruiting additional minions and promoting minions to your &quot;inner circle&quot;, which is a special zone that increases their value at the end of the game.&#10;&#10;When you set up the game, you create an 80-card deck by shuffling two 40-card half-decks together, with the half-decks being Drow, Dragons, Demons, and Elemental Evil.&#10;&#10;A central marketplace has new minions that can be recruited through influence, one of two resources in the game; purchased cards are placed in your discard pile, then shuffled together with other cards in your deck when needed.

After digging, a player can:&#10;&#10;&#10;     Discard one or more maps to explore one chamber of the monument, looking at all the cards there and keeping some number of them.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Trade at the marketplace by laying down one or more treasure cards and picking up cards with equal or lesser trading value.&#10;&#10;&#10;&#10;     Sell to the museum by placing sets of treasure cards in front of them; in general, the more cards you have of a type, the more the set is worth.&#10;&#10;&#10;Players can explore only once, but they can do the other actions repeatedly, and they can take these actions in any order. Once the deck is empty, players keep taking actions until they all pass in turn, after which they sell treasures to the museum. Whoever ends up with the most money wins!&#10;&#10;According to the designer, Archaeology: The New Expedition differs from Archaeology: The Card Game through the inclusion of tent cards, the addition of new treasure types and additional cards to allow for five players, the adjustment of some treasure values, and the inclusion of six monuments instead of one to have more variety when exploring.&#10;&#10;";5;20;10;2;20;Archaeology: The New Expedition;20;2016;Atha Kanaani;Card Game;Phil Walker-Harding;Archaeology,Country: Egypt,Rummy Games;Card Drafting,Press Your Luck,Set Collection;Z-Man Games;7.3113100000000015;1132;archaeology: the new expedition;76;0.0;0.0;3.4487177419354844;0;0.16;Qbmxkc72UX;False;0;5.0;30.0;10.0;2.0;15.0;Archaeology: The New Expedition;62;2-5;349;15-30;15.99;31.95;0.0;0.0;1355;2016.0;archaeology: the new expedition

At the start of the game, each player draws three animal tiles, chooses one of these tiles, and places it on a bracket of his ark without showing it to the other players.&#10;&#10;The leftover animals that players initially drew begin forming what will become a single animal collective in the center of the table. The total number of animals in the collective is based on the number of players, but one animal in the collective will always be face-down. Each player also starts with one food crate and may never have more than five food crates at any time.&#10;&#10;On each turn, a player has two options: (a) split a collective of animals into two groups and take a food crate, or (b) take one of the animal collectives into their ark by paying a food crate for each animal in that group. As players choose their group of animals, they drop out of the turn. The first player to drop out of a turn starts the next turn. The game ends when an ark has at least ten animals on board.&#10;&#10;Before scoring, all animals in pairs are discarded because a guy called Noah claims all animal pairs for himself.

Thus, sometimes have to wait for other players to remove their tokens by playing their actions. If you are not in majority anywhere, you have to remove all of your tokens from an action and give up hope of playing this action.

1184;10301;194655;"Santorini is a non-abstract re-imagining of the 2004 edition. Since its original inception over 30 years ago, Santorini has been endlessly developed, enhanced and refined by mathematician and educator, Dr. Gordon Hamilton.&#10;&#10;Santorini is a highly accessible pure strategy game that is simple enough for an elementary school classroom. But with enough gameplay depth and content for even hardcore gamers to explore, Santorini is truly a game for everyone. The rules are deceptively simple. Each turn consists of 2 steps:&#10;&#10;1. Move - move one of your builders into a neighboring space. You may move your Builder Pawn on the same level, step-up one level, or step down any number of levels.&#10;&#10;2. Build - Then construct a building level adjacent to the builder you moved.  When building on top of the third level, place a dome instead, removing that space from play.&#10;&#10;Winning the game - If either of your builders reaches the third level, you win.&#10;&#10;Variable player powers - What makes Santorini truly special is its seamless integration of variable player powers into a pure-strategy game.  Dr Hamilton has designed over 40 thematic god and hero powers, each fundamentally changing the way the game is played.&#10;&#10;";4;20;8;2;20;Santorini;20;2016;Lina Cossette,David Forest;Abstract Strategy,Ancient,Mythology;Gord!;3D Games,5x5 grid,Country: Greece,Crowdfunding: Kickstarter,Games by the Game Artisans of Canada,Islands: Santorini;Grid Movement,Tile Placement,Variable Player Powers;Roxley;8.08233;4444;santorini;2;1.5;2.833333333333333;3.722096920289853;0;0.03;VibNUMwsqr;False;8;4.0;30.0;8.0;2.0;15.0;Santorini;480;2-4;4882;15-30;29.1;44.95;34.95;0.0;5680;2016.0;santorini

1214;10412;202670;"Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails takes the familiar gameplay of Ticket to Ride and expands it across the globe &mdash; which means that you'll be moving across water, of course, and that's where the sails come in.&#10;&#10;As in other Ticket to Ride games, in Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails players start with tickets in hand that show two cities, and over the course of the game they try to collect colored cards, then claim routes on the game board with their colored train and ship tokens, scoring points while doing so. When any player has six or fewer tokens in their supply, each player takes two more turns, then the game ends. At that point, if they've created a continuous path between the two cities on a ticket, then they score the points on that ticket; if not, then they lose points instead.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails puts a few twists on the TtR formula, starting with split card decks of trains and ships (with all of the wild cards going in the train deck). Three cards of each type are revealed at the start of the game, and when you draw cards, you replace them with a card from whichever deck you like. (Shuffle the card types separately to form new decks when needed.)&#10;&#10;Similarly, players choose their own mix of train and ship tokens at the start of the game. To claim a train route (rectangular spaces), you must play train cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with train tokens, and to claim a ship route (oval spaces), you must play ship cards (or wilds) and cover those spaces with ship tokens. Ship cards depict one or two ships on them, and when you play a double-ship card, you can cover one or two ship spaces. You can take an action during play to swap train tokens for ships (or vice versa), and you lose one point for each token you swap.&#10;&#10;Some tickets show tour routes with multiple cities instead of simply two cities. If you build a network that matches the tour exactly, you score more points than if you simply include all of those cities in your network.&#10;&#10;Each player also starts the game with three harbors. If you have built a route to a port city, you can take an action during the game to place a harbor in that city (with a limit of one harbor per port). To place the harbor, you must discard two train cards and two ship cards of the same color, all of which must bear the harbor symbol (an anchor). At the end of the game, you lose four points for each harbor not placed, and you gain 10-40 points for each placed harbor depending on how many of your completed tickets show that port city.&#10;&#10;Ticket to Ride: Rails &amp; Sails includes a double-sided game board, with one side showing the world and the other side showing the Great Lakes of North America. Players start with a differing number of cards and tokens depending on which side they play, and each side has a few differences in gameplay.&#10;&#10;";5;120;10;2;60;Ticket to Ride: Rails & Sails;120;2016;Cyrille Daujean,Julien Delval;Trains,Travel;Alan R.

Whenever no unplanted box is visible on a bed, you have completed it, then you count your points and replace it with a fresh, unplanted bed.

In Capital Lux, you always balance on a razor's edge, so will you take risks? Bluff? Or follow a carefully laid plan? The choice is yours in this clever card game, featuring beautiful art by American painter Kwanchai Moriya.&#10;&#10;Each round begins with the players drafting a hand of five or six character cards. On your turn, you must play a card either in front of you (your hometown) or in the middle of the table (the capital). When you play a card into the capital, you benefit from the card's special ability. Each character belongs to one of four professions, and their special abilities are:&#10;&#10;&#10;    Merchant: Take 1 gold coin. Gold coins can be used at the end of a round to increase your own limit for one of the four professions.&#10;    Agent: Draw a secret modifier card and add it (face down) to one of the four professions in the capital. This will affect the limit of the chosen profession at round's end.&#10;    Scholar: Draw a card from the deck into your hand.&#10;    Cleric: Move the lowest valued card of any profession from the capital into your hometown&#10;&#10;&#10;At the end of a round, for each profession, you are not allowed to have a higher total value in your hometown than the current total value in the capital. If you break the limit for one of the professions, you lose all cards of that profession from your hometown. At the end of the third round, all characters remaining in a player's hometown are worth points.&#10;&#10;This means that for every card there's a dilemma of whether to add it to your hometown for possible points, or to the capital which not only gives you the benefit from a special ability, but also increases the potential points for all players.

The old city walls have just been torn down, finally freeing the city's growth outward towards the old villages that surround it. Based on the plans by Cerd&agrave;, the construction of Barcelona's famous Eixample (Catalan for &quot;expansion&quot;) has begun. It is a period of great prosperity when the burgeoning upper middle class families found their fortunes and used their wealth to demonstrate their power by constructing unique buildings and supporting initiatives for the city's inhabitants. However, not everything is so pleasant in the city. Its prosperity is drawing more and more people to work in the big city, and revolutionary movements are taking hold among the city's unemployed workers.&#10;&#10;Barcelona: The Rose of Fire is a board game for 2-4 players in which the players compete for social prestige and personal wealth while trying to avoid the revolution that is spreading through the city.&#10;&#10;In more detail, the players take turns using cards to build their influence by constructing buildings (tiles) in the new city, outside the old medieval walls. The better and more spectacular the construction, the more notoriety they gain. But at the same time, this construction boon brings many workers who are living in much cheaper venues. Building high-class buildings, while rewarding in terms of prestige, may generate unrest amongst the popular classes. In order to avoid strikes and riots, players have to make sure that they construct buildings for the popular classes as well.&#10;&#10;During the construction phase, players place workers in the Raval zone depending on the sort of buildings they construct. At the end of each era, all those workers are placed into a bag, alongside peacekeeping soldiers. Depending on the level of unrest, a number of these figures are drawn from the bag and the player with more figures drawn from their color suffers a strike.&#10;&#10;";4;90;10;2;70;Barcelona: The Rose of Fire;90;2016;David Parcerisa;City Building;Marco Maggi,Francesco Nepitello;Catalonia,Cities: Barcelona (Spain);Area Control / Area Influence,Tile Placement;Devir;6.75758;124;barcelona: the rose of fire;62;0.0;0.0;4.0;0;0.35;dfNF8Pz9yM;False;0;4.0;90.0;10.0;2.0;70.0;Barcelona: The Rose of Fire;2;2-4;10;70-90;38.99;0.0;52.24;24.0;118;2016.0;barcelona: the rose of fire

Versions will appear on the individual item pages.&#10;&#10;    &#10;&#10;&#10;&#10; Game description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Star Wars: Destiny is a collectible dice and card game of battles between iconic heroes and villains that encompasses characters, locations, and themes from the entire Star Wars saga.&#10;&#10;In Star Wars: Destiny, two players engage in a fast-paced duel, each striving to eliminate the other's characters first. The game's innovative mechanisms combine dice-driven combat with faction-driven hand management. Straightforward rules make the game easy to learn, but also enable deep strategic thinking and clever deck-building. Players can create decks that include characters from every faction and any era, as long as heroes and villains are on opposite sides of the fight. For example, Padm&eacute; Amidala might fight alongside Rey and Finn, taking on Jabba the Hutt, Kylo Ren, and Jango Fett.&#10;&#10;Each round, you use your characters' abilities, an assortment of dice, and a carefully constructed thirty-card deck filled with events, upgrades, and supports. You and your opponent alternate actions: activating your dice, playing cards from your hand, attacking your foes, and claiming the battlefield. You need to prove your skills and defeat your opponent's characters to claim your destiny!&#10;&#10;At launch in November 2016, Star Wars: Destiny consists of two starter sets &mdash; Rey and Kylo Ren, each with nine dice and 24 cards &mdash; and the Awakenings booster packs, each containing one die and five cards.&#10;&#10;";2;30;10;2;30;Star Wars: Destiny;30;2016;;Collectible Components,Dice,Fighting,Movies / TV / Radio theme,Science Fiction;Corey Konieczka,Lukas Litzsinger;CCGs (Collectible Card Games),CDGs (Collectible Dice Games),Star Wars,Star Wars: Destiny;Dice Rolling,Hand Management,Variable Player Powers;Fantasy Flight Games,Asmodee,Asterion Press,Delta Vision Publishing,Edge Entertainment,Galakta,Heidelberger Spieleverlag;8.15226;1658;star wars: destiny;29;0.0;0.0;4.520945945945947;0;0.0;InZ8fuJ07I;False;0;2.0;30.0;10.0;2.0;30.0;Star Wars: Destiny;74;2;927;30;0.0;0.0;26.95;0.0;344;2016.0;star wars: destiny
1232;10471;205610;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;The king has called for a lavish feast and tourney, the likes of which have not been seen in the Seven Kingdoms since the days of Aegon the Conquerer. What's more, the king has declared that at this feast, he will choose his new Hand &mdash; and you have a chance of rising to this lofty position. Of course, you're not the only one with eyes set on becoming the power behind the Iron Throne. In A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King, you need to scheme and backstab to outwit your opponents, and you need the help of Varys, the Master of Whispers, to do it.&#10;&#10;Hand of the King is a fast-paced card game of conspiracies and sudden twists of fate for two to four players, challenging each of you to gain the most support among the twisted intrigues of the King&rsquo;s Landing court. Each turn, you send Varys to do your bidding, moving through the court and inciting iconic characters from A Song of Ice and Fire to support your cause. With the help of some companions and crafty alliances with other players, you just might rise to become the king's new Hand!&#10;&#10;In more detail, players move Varys in orthogonal lines in a 6x6 grid, stopping it on a character token, then collecting that token and any other character from that House that you passed over. Possess as many characters from a House as someone else, and you claim the banner from that person. Collect the final character from a House, and you immediately use the power of one of six companions; since the game contains fourteen companions, the mix of powers will differ each game.&#10;&#10;";4;30;14;2;15;A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King;30;2016;Mihajlo Dimitrievski;Card Game,Fantasy;Bruno Cathala;A Song of Ice and Fire;Card Drafting,Grid Movement,Set Collection;Asterion Press,Fantasy Flight Games,Galakta,Heidelberger Spieleverlag,Kaissa Chess & Games;7.03309;668;a game of thrones: hand of the king;28;0.0;0.0;3.1961279461279464;0;0.17;18IdkflEML;False;0;4.0;30.0;14.0;2.0;15.0;A Game of Thrones: Hand of the King;66;2-4;316;15-30;10.73;18.0;14.44;10.39;427;2016.0;a game of thrones: hand of the king
1233;10472;205637;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;Something evil stirs in Arkham, and only you can stop it. Blurring the traditional lines between roleplaying and card game experiences, Arkham Horror: The Card Game is a Living Card Game of Lovecraftian mystery, monsters, and madness!&#10;&#10;In the game, you and your friend (or up to three friends with two Core Sets) become characters within the quiet New England town of Arkham. You have your talents, sure, but you also have your flaws. Perhaps you've dabbled a little too much in the writings of the Necronomicon, and its words continue to haunt you. Perhaps you feel compelled to cover up any signs of otherworldly evils, hampering your own investigations in order to protect the quiet confidence of the greater population. Perhaps you'll be scarred by your encounters with a ghoulish cult.&#10;&#10;No matter what compels you, no matter what haunts you, you'll find both your strengths and weaknesses reflected in your custom deck of cards, and these cards will be your resources as you work with your friends to unravel the world's most terrifying mysteries.&#10;&#10;Each of your adventures in Arkham Horror LCG carries you deeper into mystery. You'll find cultists and foul rituals. You'll find haunted houses and strange creatures. And you may find signs of the Ancient Ones straining against the barriers to our world...&#10;&#10;The basic mode of play in Arkham LCG is not the adventure, but the campaign. You might be scarred by your adventures, your sanity may be strained, and you may alter Arkham's landscape, burning buildings to the ground. All your choices and actions have consequences that reach far beyond the immediate resolution of the scenario at hand &mdash; and your actions may earn you valuable experience with which you can better prepare yourself for the adventures that still lie before you.&#10;&#10;";2;120;14;1;60;Arkham Horror: The Card Game;120;2016;Christopher Hosch,Ignacio Bazán Lazcano,Henning Ludvigsen,Mercedes Opheim,Zoe Robinson,Evan Simonet;Adventure,Card Game,Collectible Components,Fantasy,Horror,Novel-based;Nate French,Matthew Newman;Arkham Horror,Campaign Games,Cthulhu Mythos,Living Card Game,Solitaire Games;Action Point Allowance System,Co-operative Play,Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management,Role Playing,Variable Player Powers;Asterion Press,Edge Entertainment,Fantasy Flight Games,Galakta,Heidelberger Spieleverlag;8.42193;4998;arkham horror: the card game;4;3.25;2.75;3.969977201481904;0;0.33;4G32qGJZWs;False;6;2.0;120.0;14.0;1.0;60.0;Arkham Horror: The Card Game;319;1-2;2758;60-120;29.99;53.95;38.97;0.0;7258;2016.0;arkham horror: the card game

It is here, in New Angeles, that you'll find the global headquarters for the worlds' most powerful megacorps: Haas-Bioroid, Globalsec, Jinteki, Melange Mining, NBN, and the Weyland Consortium. And it is here, in this shining beacon of human achievement and advancement, that these powerful megacorps enjoy a uniquely fertile breeding ground for their projects and their rivalries.&#10;&#10;In New Angeles, you gain control of one of these megacorporations, then you use your wealth and influence to create more wealth and more influence. To do this, you cut deals and forge temporary alliances. You leverage your credits and assets to gain financial superiority over your corporate rivals.

You must get to the Abyss, lair of the Darkhouse, before the Phantom Submarine (his henchman) reaches your homeland, the Happy Isles &mdash; but to defeat the Darkhouse, not only must you be faster than the Phantom Submarine, you must also assemble the submarine's crew along the way.&#10;&#10;Each turn, you roll three dice and give one to each of these figures: the Nautilion, the Phantom Submarine, and the Darkhouse. The dice of the Nautilion and the Phantom Submarine move those figures along a path formed by Crew tokens: the Nautilion from the Happy Isles towards the Abyss; the Phantom Submarine in the opposite direction. The crew token on which your Nautilion ends its move joins your submarine, the one the Phantom Submarine reaches is lost!&#10;&#10;Only four copies exist of each of the nine different tokens, so you have to decide carefully which die you need and which you can leave to your enemies. (The Darkhouse doesn't move, but inflicts damage to you each time he gets a die with a high value.) To win, you need to reach the Abyss with a full crew of nine different tokens.&#10;&#10;Five expansions are included with the game, adding new crew members, powers, treacheries and challenges.&#10;&#10;";2;30;10;1;15;Nautilion;30;2016;Élise Plessis;Dice,Fantasy,Nautical;Shadi Torbey;Oniverse,Solitaire Games;Co-operative Play,Modular Board,Roll / Spin and Move,Set Collection;Filosofia Éditions,Z-Man Games;7.57967;257;nautilion;64;0.0;0.0;3.5735294117647056;0;0.2;WhuvfTVfny;False;0;2.0;30.0;10.0;1.0;15.0;Nautilion;17;1-2;144;15-30;19.99;37.99;24.95;0.0;559;2016.0;nautilion
1236;10486;206490;"Description from the publisher:&#10;&#10;It&rsquo;s 1833. The East India Company has just had its monopoly of trade revoked by an official act of Parliament. You, and others like you, see a golden opportunity for profit in China. For too long the Company&rsquo;s polite deference to the Qing has smothered progress and stifled trade. There is real money to be made here and you intend to make it.&#10;&#10;An Infamous Traffic is a brutal economic board game for two to five souls brave enough to conduct the opium trade in the fracturing political landscape of 19th century Qing China. Initially, you will need to rely on smugglers in order to get your products into the interior, but, if Parliament can be swayed, perhaps an open war can make the trade more secure. At the same time, you&rsquo;ll want to be careful. If British aggression goes unchecked, the region may become a failed state, which could jeopardize your hard fought gains.&#10;&#10;Of course, the massive wealth you&rsquo;ll earn won&rsquo;t be enough. Trade is still a dirty word among those in the top rungs of society. You certainly haven't forgotten how your business holdings were sneered at by some prodigal baronet during your brief stint at Oxford. They don&rsquo;t understand. The empire they enjoy was built on trade, not pedigree. So, you&rsquo;ll play their game, snatching up the precious symbols of nobility with your hard won cash. Perhaps you can restore a beloved castle and stuff it full of the latest luxuries. The right marriage or government post would certainly guarantee your place in society. You might even be tempted to rob your own firm to get that extra edge back home.&#10;&#10;In any case, there&rsquo;s demand for opium in China, and you intend to meet it.&#10;&#10;";5;90;14;2;45;An Infamous Traffic;90;2016;Cole Wehrle;Economic,Industry / Manufacturing,Political;Cole Wehrle;;Chit-Pull System,Dice Rolling,Partnerships,Route/Network Building,Simulation;Hollandspiele;7.27418;92;an infamous traffic;12;0.0;0.0;3.35;0;0.0;9beUkPj83H;False;0;5.0;90.0;14.0;2.0;45.0;An Infamous Traffic;10;2-5;37;45-90;0.0;0.0;0.0;0.0;892;2016.0;an infamous traffic

On your turn, you have the opportunity to both play and prepare a card. You can also spend cards to draft more troops, or use cards to attrition your opponents. However, your deck represents your overall resources, so moving too quickly through your deck early might result in your unsupported armies being swept away in the final rounds of the game. This is worth it if you can capture Berlin or Paris in 1915, but if your gambit fails, you may have a tough road ahead.&#10;&#10;The game ends after 17 rounds of play, or earlier if one side has a commanding lead.&#10;&#10;";5;120;12;2;90;Quartermaster General: 1914;120;2016;Nicholas Avallone;Wargame,World War I;Ian Brody;Quartermaster Series;Area Control / Area Influence,Campaign / Battle Card Driven,Card Drafting,Co-operative Play,Deck / Pool Building,Hand Management;PSC Games;7.93394;193;quartermaster general: 1914;91;0.0;0.0;3.7;0;0.0;xwzACZ1ivV;True;0;5.0;120.0;12.0;2.0;90.0;Quartermaster General: 1914;10;2-5;30;90-120;34.97;67.95;0.0;31.8;237;2016.0;quartermaster general: 1914
